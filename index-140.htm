is DeFi?</h3><p>DeFi is an abbreviation of the phrase decentralized finance which generally refers to digital assets and financial smart contracts, protocols, and decentralized applications (DApps), most of which are built on Ethereum. In simpler terms, it&#x27;s financial software built on the blockchain that can be pieced together like Money Legos. <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-defi/">Read more about DeFi</a>.</p><h3>What’s the purpose of DeFi Pulse?</h3><p>DeFi Pulse is a site where you can find the latest analytics and rankings of DeFi protocols. Our rankings track the total value locked into the smart contracts of popular DeFi applications and protocols. Additionally, we curate <a href="https://defipulse.com/defi-list/">The DeFi List</a>, a collection of the best resources in DeFi, <a href="https://yieldfarmer.substack.com/">DeFi Pulse Farmer</a>, a newsletter covering the latest news and opportunities in DeFi. You can also learn about developments and opportunities in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem by subscribing to our <a href="https://bit.ly/3xDBoBZ">Dot Pulse</a> newsletter. </p><h3>How do we calculate total value locked (TVL)?</h3><p>DeFi Pulse monitors each protocol’s underlying smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Every hour, we refresh our charts by pulling the total balance of Ether (ETH) and ERC-20 tokens held by these smart contracts. TVL(USD) is calculated by taking these balances and multiplying them by their price in USD. You can view the open source project adapters that power our metrics <a href="https://github.com/ConcourseOpen/DeFi-Pulse-Adapters">here</a>.</p><h3>How do I get involved in DeFi? </h3><p>Decentralized finance is open for anyone to take part in. You can start by exploring the resources found on <a href="https://defipulse.com/defi-list/">The DeFi List</a>. Stay informed on the latest news and opportunities in DeFi by subscribing to the <a href="https://yieldfarmer.substack.com/">DeFi Pulse Farmer</a> newsletter. You can also learn about developments and opportunities in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem by subscribing to our <a href="https://bit.ly/3xDBoBZ">Dot Pulse</a> newsletter. And if you’re looking to dive head first into the world of DeFi, we’ve written a beginner’s guide called <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/zero-to-defi-cdai/">Zero to DeFi</a>. It will teach you the basics, guiding you through how to start earning passive income via DeFi lending services.</p><h3>How do I get my project listed on DeFi Pulse? </h3><p>Check out this <a

Users can borrow Dai up to 66% of their collateral’s value (150% collateralization ratio). Vaults that fall below that rate are subject to a 13% penalty and liquidation (by anyone) to bring the Vault out of default. Liquidated collateral is sold on an open market at a 3% discount.\n\nHolders of Maker’s other token (MKR) govern the system by voting on, e.g., risk parameters such as the stability fee level. MKR holders also act as the last line of defense in case of a black swan event. If system-wide collateral value falls too low too fast, MKR is minted and sold on the open market to raise more collateral, diluting MKR holders.\n\nMaker also has a feature called the Dai Savings Rate (DSR).

Users can add or remove funds at any time, but if their debt becomes undercollateralized, anyone can liquidate; a 5% discount on liquidated assets serves as incentive for liquidators.\n\nThe Compound protocol sets aside 10% of interest paid as reserves; the rest goes to suppliers.

The market creator sets the exchange rate, which shifts through trading due to Uniswap’s “constant product market maker” mechanism. When trading reduces one side of the pair’s liquidity relative to the other, the price changes. This creates arbitrage opportunities, encouraging more trading.\n\nUniswap has no native token, but each liquidity pair is represented by a unique, freely-transferable ERC20 token.

Also, REP is used to dispute market outcomes or buy participation tokens (redeemable for a portion of ETH reporting fees collected during fee windows).\n\nUsers trade on an event’s outcome by buying and selling shares in the event’s market.

Transactions then occur off-chain, and changes to the state of the Merkle tree (user transfers, trades, etc.,) are aggregated by relayers, and compressed with a cryptographic proof (zkSNARK) attesting to its validity. Because of these validity proofs and transaction data stored on-chain, users are always able to withdraw their assets from Loopring L2 to Ethereum L1.\n\nLoopring's protocol token, LRC, is used in liquidity pools, an insurance fund, and governance of the protocol. Loopring released their first zkRollup (v3) in December 2019, and their new version (v3.6) in December 2020.

Another way to view Balancer is as an inverse ETF: instead of paying fees to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who continuously rebalance your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities.\n\nBalancer protocol is designed to be composable and has a few types of pools: 1) Private Pools where the only owner can contribute liquidity and has full permissions over the pool, being able to update any of its parameters. 2) Shared Pools where the pool’s tokens, weights, and fees are permanently set and the pool creator has no special privileges. Anyone may add liquidity to shared pools and ownership of the pool’s liquidity is tracked with a specific token called BPT - Balancer Pool Token. 3) Smart Pools which are a variation of a private pool where the controller is a smart contract, allowing for any arbitrary logic/restrictions on how pool parameters can be changed. Smart pools may also accept liquidity from anyone and issue BPTs to track ownership.\n\nBalancer was launched in March 2020 and has been [audited by Trail of Bits, https://docs.balancer.finance/protocol/security/audits].

At their core, options give a trader the choice to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a known time in the future. This is useful for protecting one's self (also known as \"hedging\") against possible price changes in the asset, as well as speculating on these price changes.\n\nSIREN uses a fully-collateralized approach to writing options. A single MarketsRegistry contract creates and coordinates individual markets. Once a Market contract is created anyone can interact with it in a permissionless manner. The solvency of a position is ensured at all times by the collateral locked in the smart contract.\n\nWith SIREN both the long and short side of the contract are tokenized. The buyer’s side (bToken) gives the holder the right to purchase or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined strike price. The seller’s/writer’s side (wToken) allows the holder to withdraw the collateral (if the option was not exercised) or withdraw the exercise payment (if the option was exercised) from the contract after expiration.\n\nTokenizing both sides of the contract allows SIREN to create secondary markets for both the long and short exposure. Under such a design in order to become a writer one purchases a wToken from the SirenSwap AMM. A writer can also unwind their short exposure by selling the wToken back to the AMM. This streamlines the write-side mechanics by reducing it to essentially purchasing the underlying collateral at a discount — as opposed to a typical design where the writer mints long tokens and has to then sell them in order to realize the premium.","how":"More information regarding SIREN is available on their [homepage, https://sirenmarkets.com/].

The first increases Keepers' expected profitability by eliminating costly competition, and the second gives participating Keepers more opportunities to profit. Combined together, this creates the infrastructure for a more secure and fair financial ecosystem for both DeFi users and protocols. Because of their coordinating Keeper Economy they're not only able to provide the most complete MEV protection in DeFi, but by having integrated Keepers capture and redistribute the MEV back to their users and partnering protocols, KeeperDAO also in essence allows them to *get paid to play.","how":"You can use [KeeperDAO's trading protocol, https://app.keeperdao.com/trade] to place free limit orders on ERC-20 token pairs.

BarnBridge aims at facilitating the transition to a decentralized financial system addressing some key aspects of institutional activity, such as risk management and access to fixed income instruments.\n\nBarnBridge has currently launched with its SMART Yield product. It allows users to tranche out the yield from the debt pools of other projects, such as Aave, Compound, Yearn Finance to normalize the risk curve by creating derivatives for risk mitigation. Users are able to buy junior or senior tokens which represent tranches. Junior token holders provide liquidity \u0026 buy risk from senior bond investors. The risk here is variable rate annuities going below expected level. Investors that buy senior bonds will have a guaranteed yield/interest rate for the life of bond. At the same time, juniors will benefit from the extra rewards generated by tokens locked by seniors in cases where the variable APY of the underlying lending protocol (including the governance token rewards) are higher than the weighted average guaranteed yields of current seniors. It is expected that the senior positions will have more capital in a pool than the junior ones so the yield may be split by them accordingly.\n\nJunior tranches are ERC-20 fungible tokens, senior tranches are ERC-721 non-fungible tokens.\n\n$BOND, the native token of BarnBridge, is an ERC-20 governance token.

UMA enables developers to quickly and easily build synthetic tokens that track the price of anything. UMA offers priceless financial contracts. Priceless financial contracts are smart contracts that only require an on-chain price feed in the event of a dispute. Priceless contracts minimize reliance on oracles, making contracts on UMA less vulnerable to attacks.\n      \nUMA's Priceless contracts are designed with mechanisms to incentivize people who mint synthetic tokens (called token sponsors) to ensure that their positions are backed with the appropriate amount of collateral. Taking out a position involves minting a synthetic token, which can be repaid to close the position and return the collateral. Positions are assumed to be solvent unless they are identified as being under collateralized. It is the responsibility of token sponsors to ensure that their positions are always backed by the required amount of collateral. A key mechanism to ensure a position is properly collateralized is a liquidations and disputes process that rewards the liquidation of positions that are under collateralized.\n\nUMA's Optimistic Oracle allows contracts to quickly request and receive price information. The Optimistic Oracle acts as a generalized escalation game between contracts that initiate a price request and UMA's dispute resolution system known as the Data Verification Mechanism (DVM). If a dispute is raised, a request is sent to the DVM. All contracts built on UMA use the DVM as a backstop to resolve disputes. Disputes sent to the DVM will be resolved 48 hours after UMA tokenholders vote on the price of the asset at a given time. Contracts on UMA do not need to use the Optimistic Oracle unless it requires a price of an asset faster than 48 hours. \n","how":"Developers can create their own financial synthetic tokens.

It enables asset owners to take advantage of DeFi’s liquidity, while DeFi users can access real-world assets unavailable to them before. The protocol combines the edge of a lowered investment entry barrier with the liquidity, automation, and transparency features of DeFi to bring real-world asset exposure to all DeFi users.","how":"Asset swaps on Convergence are a simple way to trade ERC-20 tokens via an automated liquidity pool, please visit the [guide, https://medium.com/convergencefinance/convergences-convx-product-walkthrough-45bb6ef354af] for a step by step walkthrough of how to use the AMM.\n\nAccess ConvX [here, https://convx.conv.finance/]","website":"conv.finance","links":[{"name":"Telegram","link":"https://t.me/convergencefinanceofficial"},{"name":"Twitter","link":"https://twitter.com/ConvergenceFin"},{"name":"Discord","link":"https://discord.gg/nq3Hf89yY5"},{"name":"Blog","link":"https://convergencefinance.medium.com/"}]},"origin-protocol":{"what_is":"Origin is the protocol behind Origin Dollar (OUSD), a stablecoin that earns a yield while it's still in your wallet. OUSD is designed to passively accrue interest while simply being held within users' wallets. \nThis is made possible thanks to its elastic supply, which means OUSD returns are distributed as additional units of OUSD. Supply rebasing happens multiple times per day and doesn't cost holders any gas fees. It can be thought of as automated yield farming in the form of a stablecoin.","how":"OUSD can be minted by going to https://ousd.com/, connecting your Web3 wallet, and choosing from USDC, USDT or DAI

Users can also swap their BTC for WBTC through a number of merchants, who act as sources of token distribution including Dharma, Kyber, Set Protocol, Ren, and DeversiFi, and more. To swap BTC for WBTC, a user must undergo KYC/AML with a merchant, who supplies the user’s BTC to the custodian, who mints an equal amount of WBTC. The reverse is also possible: merchants can redeem BTC by burning WBTC tokens. Users can verify that WBTC is fully-backed via on-chain proof of reserves.","how":"You can see the WBTC order book, proof of assets, and info on partners on the [WBTC dashboard, https://www.wbtc.network/dashboard/order-book].
