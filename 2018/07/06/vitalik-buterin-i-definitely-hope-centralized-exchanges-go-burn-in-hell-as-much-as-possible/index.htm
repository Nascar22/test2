				<p id="speakable-summary">Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin talked about a wide range of topics during an interview with Jon Evans at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-blockchain-2018/">TechCrunch Sessions: Blockchain</a>. He was surprisingly balanced and stated multiple times that everyone has different needs and it’s hard to live in a world where everything is centralized or decentralized.</p>
<p>“Back in 2013, when GHash had 51 percent everybody freaked out. It&#8217;s happening a second time and people aren&#8217;t really talking about it this much,” Buterin said. And it’s true that if you look at Bitmain alone, the company is edging toward <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitmain-nears-51-network-hash-rate-why-matters-and-why-it-doesnt/">51 percent</a> of network hash rate.</p>
<p>In addition to potential 51 percent attacks, it causes issues due to concentration. Buterin mentioned the Sichuan flood that are potentially affecting <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/huge-flood-in-china-could-put-an-end-to-falling-graphics-card-prices">mining operations</a> over there.</p>
<p>So it’s clear that Buterin wants to make Ethereum as decentralized as possible by design. But what he wants and what the community wants might be different. Buterin is fine with that.</p>
<p>“The Ethereum Foundation tries very hard to be a decentralized organization,” he said. “We try very hard not to have a very hard divide, such as you&#8217;re on the inside and you&#8217;re on the outside.”</p>
<p> <div embedded-video-placeholder="5b3f6ee8c0e0af183ca8c524" post-id="1669027"></div> </p>
<p>One of the big challenges to overcome to make Ethereum truly decentralized comes down to user authentication. Sure, it’s possible to generate a private key and a public key to manage your wallet yourself. Sending ETH is all about signing a transaction so it’s not that complicated.</p>
<p>But what happens if you lose the keys? What happens if you lose your password? “If all user authentication methods end up failing it&#8217;s going to be hard to reach mainstream adoption,” Buterin said.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m interested in social recovery, multi-key schemes,” he added. Buterin then explained WeChat’s social recovery system. If you lose your password, WeChat asks you to select people in your contact list within a big list of names. You can also imagine some sort of offline validation.</p>
<p>“If all fails we&#8217;ll all use Coinbase — that&#8217;ll be less fun,” he said. That remark led to a bigger discussion about decentralized exchanges.</p>
<p>“I definitely hope centralized exchanges go burn in hell as much as possible,” Buterin said. In particular, he thinks there’s no reason some projects need to pay $10 to $15 million in listing fees to let people trade their tokens on centralized exchanges.</p>
<p>According to him, centralized exchanges exist because they serve as an interface between the fiat world and the cryptocurrencies. “And the fiat world only has centralized gateways,” he said.</p>
<p>As for crypto-to-crypto exchanges, Buterin says that it’s still early days. But there are already clear advantage from a user’s point of view. For instance, you don’t need to sign up or login. You can send money to a wallet and define an output address. This way, exchanges only act as input/output tunnels, transferring tokens from one address to another in two different currencies.</p>

		<blockquote>
			It also means that we make a culture that is hostile to people who take themselves too seriously							<cite>Vitalik Buterin</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Buterin also talked about private blockchains and other projects inspired by Ethereum. “A lot of these projects ended up not going very far. Some of them ended up being not decentralized at all,” he said.</p>
<p>For instance, some companies spun up 7 nodes, but they were all controlled by the same company. So it’s not exactly decentralized. “With the public network, you have a network of 16,000 computers,” Buterin said.</p>
<p>Once again, Buterin also said that he can’t blame them entirely. “In a lot of industries, I understand that it comes down to compromises,” he said. Sometimes you have regulatory obligations that force you to centralize at least a bit.</p>
<p>“Even Plasma chains are a better way to make that compromise,” Buterin said. “You get the efficiency of a centralized server, almost the same code of a centralized server, but a public blockchain fallback in case the centralized server ends up failing.”</p>
<p>At some point, Buterin also made fun of Bitcoin’s endless disagreements. The issue is that you have multiple groups of people who truly believe they’re right and that you should do something to ‘move forward’.</p>
<p>During a previous panel, Karl Floersch from the Ethereum Foundation said that Buterin was pretty good at compromising. And Buterin has a say in the culture of the Ethereum community.</p>
<p>“Growth of the communities definitely depends on what the earliest members believe. I think it is something where we do make a deliberate effort to basically promote the right values and attract the right people both in an inclusive sense and in an exclusive sense,” he said.</p>
<p>“It also means that we make a culture that is hostile to people who take themselves too seriously.”</p>

It will also deliver unprecedented opportunity for entrepreneurs \u2014 and the investors backing them \u2014 who can turn their climate tech ideas into commercialized products and services, whether that&#8217;s plant-based foods, carbon capture, electric vehicles or battery recycling.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The difficult thing here is that we have to change everything,&#8221; O&#8217;Sullivan said while on the TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 virtual stage. &#8220;Climate tech is not just one thing that needs to be changed. We have 100 areas, 1,000 different areas that need to be reinvented and industries that need to be reconstructed.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This opportunity has helped climate tech become one of the hottest sectors to invest in. But that doesn&#8217;t mean success is guaranteed. Unlike other sectors, climate tech crosses into nearly every industry, including transportation, energy, agriculture, consumer goods, food and beverage, and packaging.<\/p>\n<p>For investors, the initial challenge is vetting the startups, along with their technology and business plan, to determine if it&#8217;s really climate tech or just window dressing.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a big and broad category that encompasses anything and everything that could lower overall carbon,&#8221; Robert noted.<\/p>\n<h2>Are people ready for climate tech?<\/h2>\n<p>Forces in entrenched industries can threaten progress even after climate tech startups successfully navigate fundraising and begin to scale. As O&#8217;Sullivan noted, people are inherently resistant to change.<\/p>\n<p>However, both investors have seen more openness.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If you listen to people today, they&#8217;re trying to figure out how to transition, blend, add.

Bijnis lands $30 million to help manufacturers build digital identity and sell to retailers"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The proliferation of affordable and fast mobile data allowed hundreds of millions of Indians to come online for the first time in the past decade. But there are scores of areas in the South Asian nation\u2019s economy that remain largely offline. One of those is factories. There are about 150,000 factories in India, but the vast majority of them lack digital means to connect and sell their products to retailers.<\/p>\n<p>About six years ago, a team of four people (Siddharth Vij, Chaitanya Rathi, Siddharth Rastogi and Shubham Agarwal) &#8212; all of whom had either personal or family background in the manufacturing business &#8212; came together to tackle this challenge.<\/p>\n<p>On Tuesday, they announced that their effort &#8212; the startup <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bijnis.com\">Bijnis<\/a> &#8212; continues to make inroads in the market and has won the trust of several investors.<\/p>\n<p>Bijnis has raised $30 million in a Series B financing round led by Westbridge Capital, they announced. The new funding also saw participation from existing investors including Sequoia India, InfoEdge, Waterbridge Ventures and Matrix Partners India.<\/p>\n<p>The New Delhi-headquartered startup operates an eponymous mobile app that Vij, in an interview with TechCrunch, described as an \u201coperating system for factories.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Bijnis app helps factory operators generate demand from buyers and other retailers alike and also helps them procure supplies. It also offers manufacturers with logistics and payments services &#8212; through partnerships with several popular players in the industry.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe problem is that these manufacturers spend the vast majority of their time running factories. So they rely on wholesalers and other agents for buying and selling. These players don\u2019t share the identity to the buyers as this is how they get to squeeze a lot of money from the manufacturers,\u201d he explained.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Bijnis is trying to remove the traditional agents from the equation to help manufacturers considerably improve their profits &#8212; and also aggressively expand by discovering new customers.

The platform has also onboarded over 100,000 retailers.<\/p>\n<p>But the new fund, the startup said, will help it win more manufacturers and retailers as increasingly more businesses are becoming aware of Bijnis\u2019 offerings.

plan to spend $11.4 billion to build two massive campuses in Tennessee and Kentucky that will produce batteries as well as the next generation of electric F-Series trucks \u2014 a project the companies said will create 11,000 new jobs.<\/p>\n<p>Facilities on the two campuses are designed to cover the entire ecosystem of building an electric vehicle<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> from battery cell production and recycling to a supplier park and an assembly plant. <\/span>Ford is contributing $7 billion to the project, the largest single manufacturing investment in its 118-year history. The investment is part of Ford&#8217;s previously announced plan to put $30 billion toward electric vehicles by 2025.<\/p>\n<p>The automaker also said it will spend $525 million over the next five years on high-tech job training across the United States, starting in Texas. The investment will focus on training auto technicians to support Ford&#8217;s coming onslaught of electric and connected vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>Ford&#8217;s &#8220;mega campus&#8221; plans \u2014 the first facilities that the automaker has constructed in a generation \u2014 are meant to support its growing portfolio of EVs, including the Mustang Mach-E, the Ford E-Transit cargo van and the upcoming F-150 Lightning pickup truck, which has already received more than 150,000 pre-orders from customers. It&#8217;s also part of the company&#8217;s strategy to drive down battery costs to the $80 per kilowatt-hour pack level.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The timing of these investments is very important because we see a critical mass for a transition to battery electric vehicles right on the horizon,&#8221; Lisa Drake, Ford&#8217;s chief operating officer in North America, said in a media briefing Monday. &#8220;And we&#8217;ve already seen evidence of that in the industry and now from our own recent product launches.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And Ford is bullish on the demand for EVs. The company predicts that one-third of the full-size pickup segment will be fully electric by 2030, Drake noted.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2208886\" style=\"width: 970px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Blue-Oval-City_GIF.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2208886\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2208886 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Blue-Oval-City_GIF.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2208886\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Ford<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Monday&#8217;s announcement follows a string of planned investments by Ford, including\u00a0an <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/16\/ford-boosts-spending-to-increase-production-capacity-of-its-f-150-lightning-electric-truck\/\">injection of $250 million<\/a> and 450 new jobs to increase production capacity of its upcoming F-150 Lightning to 80,000 all-electric trucks annually. Those funds and jobs will be spread out across its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan, Van Dyke Electric Powertrain Center and Rawsonville Components Plant, Ford said.<\/p>\n<p>It also comes less than a week since Ford announced plans to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/22\/ford-partners-with-battery-recycling-and-materials-startup-redwood-materials-amid-ev-push\/\">partner with Redwood Materials<\/a> to create a closed loop system that will cover recycling production scrap and EVs at the end of their life as well as supplying the automaker with raw battery materials. Securing a supply of batteries &#8212; or the materials to make them &#8212; has prompted the automotive industry to partner with cell manufacturers and increasingly turn to companies like Redwood Materials.<\/p>\n<p>Drake provided more details about that partnership Monday, noting that Redwood Materials will set up a recycling facility on its so-called Blue Oval City campus near Memphis, Tennessee.<\/p>\n<h2>Tennessee campus<\/h2>\n<p>Once completed. the $5.6 billion campus in Stanton, Tennessee will rival the size and population of a small village. The 3,600-acre campus, or nearly 6 square miles, will be designed as a closed loop manufacturing center. This means that materials used in production can be reused to make new EVs.<\/p>\n<p>The campus will have a battery production facility operated in partnership with SK, a supplier park and an assembly plant dedicated to electric F-Series trucks. The battery manufacturing facility will be able to produce 43 gigawatt hours of cell capacity. Ford said the assembly plant will be designed to be carbon neutral from the start of production in 2025.<\/p>\n<h2>Kentucky campus<\/h2>\n<p>Ford said it will build twin battery plants on the campus located in the central Kentucky town of Glendale. Batteries produced at the plants will be used in a new lineup of Ford and Lincoln electric vehicles later this decade. Production of the lithium-ion batteries is expected to begin in 2025.<\/p>\n<p>The 1,500-acre battery campus, which Ford is calling BlueOvalSK Battery Park, will cost about $5.8 billion and employ 5,000 people. The twin battery plants will be capable of producing up to 43 gigawatt hours each for a total of 86 gigawatt hours annually. Adding in the third battery cell plant in Tennessee will push the total capacity up to 129 GWh, according to Yoosuk Kim, executive vice president and global head of marketing at SK.<\/p>\n<p>In all, that&#8217;s enough capacity to power over 1 million electric vehicles, Drake said.<\/p>\n<p>Ford has previously said that its global plans for battery electric vehicle calls for at least 240 gigawatt hours of battery cell capacity by 2030. That is roughly 10 plants\u2019 worth of capacity. Ford has previously said that 140 GWh will be required in North America, with the balance dedicated to other regions, including Europe and China.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ford Motor Company and battery manufacturer SK Innovation plan to spend $11.4 billion to build two massive campuses in Tennessee and Kentucky that will produce batteries as well as the next generation of electric F-Series trucks \u2014 a project the companies said will create 11,000 new jobs.

That&#8217;s often a hallmark of consumer-grade spyware, which can also steal messages, photos, web browsing history and real-time location data from a victim&#8217;s phone without their permission.<\/p>\n<p>The rising threat of spyware has prompted both <a href=\"https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT211876\">Apple<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.android.com\/about\/versions\/12\/behavior-changes-all#mic-camera-indicators\">Google<\/a> to introduce indicators when a device&#8217;s microphone or camera are used. But some of the more elusive and more capable spyware \u2014 the spyware typically used by governments and nation states \u2014 can <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/24\/nso-pegasus-bahrain-iphone-security\/\">slip past the hardened defenses<\/a> built into iOS and Android.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s where Malloc says Antistalker comes in. Malloc&#8217;s co-founders Maria Terzi, Artemis Kontou and Liza Charalambous built the app around a machine learning (ML) model, which allows the app to detect and block device activity that could be construed as spyware recording or sending data.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2208536\" style=\"width: 1090px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2208536\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2208536 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/malloc-privacy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/malloc-privacy.jpg 1080w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/malloc-privacy.jpg?resize=128,128 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2208536\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Malloc co-founders Liza Charalambous (left), Maria Terzi (middle), Artemis Kontou (right). <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Malloc\/supplied<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Terzi, who specializes in ML, told TechCrunch that the startup trained its ML model using known stalkerware apps to help simulate real-world surveillance. Machine learning helps to improve the app&#8217;s ability to detect a broad range of new and previously unknown threats over time, rather than relying on the more traditional methods of scanning for signatures of known spyware apps.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We already know applications that are spyware. Why don&#8217;t we use their behavior to train a machine learning model that will then be able to recognize new spyware?&#8221; Terzi told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>The ML model runs on the device to be more privacy-preserving than sending data to the cloud. Malloc said it collects some anonymized data to improve the ML model over time, to help the app to detect more threats as they emerge on users&#8217; devices.<\/p>\n<p>The app also looks for anomalous app activity, like bursts of data sent by apps that haven&#8217;t been used for days, and allows the user to look at which apps have accessed the microphone and camera and when.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bet that&#8217;s already catching the eyes of investors, with the startup securing close to $2 million from Y Combinator and the Urban Innovation Fund.<\/p>\n<p>Terzi said the company has more than 80,000 monthly active users \u2014 and growing \u2014 since it launched earlier this year, and plans an enterprise offering to help companies protect their employees from surveillance threats.

Buterin: \u201cI definitely hope centralized exchanges go burn in hell as much as possible\u201d"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin talked about a wide range of topics during an interview with Jon Evans at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/tc-sessions-blockchain-2018\/\">TechCrunch Sessions: Blockchain<\/a>. He was surprisingly balanced and stated multiple times that everyone has different needs and it\u2019s hard to live in a world where everything is centralized or decentralized.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBack in 2013, when GHash had 51 percent everybody freaked out. It&#8217;s happening a second time and people aren&#8217;t really talking about it this much,\u201d Buterin said. And it\u2019s true that if you look at Bitmain alone, the company is edging toward <a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinmagazine.com\/articles\/bitmain-nears-51-network-hash-rate-why-matters-and-why-it-doesnt\/\">51 percent<\/a> of network hash rate.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to potential 51 percent attacks, it causes issues due to concentration. Buterin mentioned the Sichuan flood that are potentially affecting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/news\/huge-flood-in-china-could-put-an-end-to-falling-graphics-card-prices\">mining operations<\/a> over there.<\/p>\n<p>So it\u2019s clear that Buterin wants to make Ethereum as decentralized as possible by design. But what he wants and what the community wants might be different. Buterin is fine with that.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Ethereum Foundation tries very hard to be a decentralized organization,\u201d he said. \u201cWe try very hard not to have a very hard divide, such as you&#8217;re on the inside and you&#8217;re on the outside.\u201d<\/p>\n<p> <div embedded-video-placeholder=\"5b3f6ee8c0e0af183ca8c524\" post-id=\"1669027\"><\/div> <\/p>\n<p>One of the big challenges to overcome to make Ethereum truly decentralized comes down to user authentication. Sure, it\u2019s possible to generate a private key and a public key to manage your wallet yourself. Sending ETH is all about signing a transaction so it\u2019s not that complicated.<\/p>\n<p>But what happens if you lose the keys? What happens if you lose your password? \u201cIf all user authentication methods end up failing it&#8217;s going to be hard to reach mainstream adoption,\u201d Buterin said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI&#8217;m interested in social recovery, multi-key schemes,\u201d he added. Buterin then explained WeChat\u2019s social recovery system. If you lose your password, WeChat asks you to select people in your contact list within a big list of names. You can also imagine some sort of offline validation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf all fails we&#8217;ll all use Coinbase \u2014 that&#8217;ll be less fun,\u201d he said. That remark led to a bigger discussion about decentralized exchanges.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI definitely hope centralized exchanges go burn in hell as much as possible,\u201d Buterin said. In particular, he thinks there\u2019s no reason some projects need to pay $10 to $15 million in listing fees to let people trade their tokens on centralized exchanges.<\/p>\n<p>According to him, centralized exchanges exist because they serve as an interface between the fiat world and the cryptocurrencies. \u201cAnd the fiat world only has centralized gateways,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>As for crypto-to-crypto exchanges, Buterin says that it\u2019s still early days. But there are already clear advantage from a user\u2019s point of view. For instance, you don\u2019t need to sign up or login. You can send money to a wallet and define an output address. This way, exchanges only act as input\/output tunnels, transferring tokens from one address to another in two different currencies.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tIt also means that we make a culture that is hostile to people who take themselves too seriously\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<cite>Vitalik Buterin<\/cite>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>Buterin also talked about private blockchains and other projects inspired by Ethereum. \u201cA lot of these projects ended up not going very far. Some of them ended up being not decentralized at all,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, some companies spun up 7 nodes, but they were all controlled by the same company. So it\u2019s not exactly decentralized. \u201cWith the public network, you have a network of 16,000 computers,\u201d Buterin said.<\/p>\n<p>Once again, Buterin also said that he can\u2019t blame them entirely. \u201cIn a lot of industries, I understand that it comes down to compromises,\u201d he said. Sometimes you have regulatory obligations that force you to centralize at least a bit.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEven Plasma chains are a better way to make that compromise,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cYou get the efficiency of a centralized server, almost the same code of a centralized server, but a public blockchain fallback in case the centralized server ends up failing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At some point, Buterin also made fun of Bitcoin\u2019s endless disagreements. The issue is that you have multiple groups of people who truly believe they\u2019re right and that you should do something to \u2018move forward\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>During a previous panel, Karl Floersch from the Ethereum Foundation said that Buterin was pretty good at compromising. And Buterin has a say in the culture of the Ethereum community.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGrowth of the communities definitely depends on what the earliest members believe. I think it is something where we do make a deliberate effort to basically promote the right values and attract the right people both in an inclusive sense and in an exclusive sense,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt also means that we make a culture that is hostile to people who take themselves too seriously.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Vitalik-Buterin-Ethereum-TC-Sessions-Blockchain-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1669259\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Vitalik-Buterin-Ethereum-TC-Sessions-Blockchain-2.jpg 5472w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Vitalik-Buterin-Ethereum-TC-Sessions-Blockchain-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Vitalik-Buterin-Ethereum-TC-Sessions-Blockchain-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Vitalik-Buterin-Ethereum-TC-Sessions-Blockchain-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Vitalik-Buterin-Ethereum-TC-Sessions-Blockchain-2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Vitalik-Buterin-Ethereum-TC-Sessions-Blockchain-2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Vitalik-Buterin-Ethereum-TC-Sessions-Blockchain-2.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Vitalik-Buterin-Ethereum-TC-Sessions-Blockchain-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><i>Watch my panel on scaling Ethereum:<\/i><\/p>\n<p> <div embedded-video-placeholder=\"5b3f571c600c9a0b269444c5\" post-id=\"1668831\"><\/div> <\/p>\n<p><i>Disclosure: I own small amounts of various cryptocurrencies.<\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin talked about a wide range of topics during an interview with Jon Evans at TechCrunch Sessions: Blockchain.
