										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Crypto.com (CRO) is both the name of the flagship token and the ecosystem that revolves around its homonym cryptocurrency, whose utility is expressed by several services tied to it, including a physical VISA card (that users can utilize to make purchases and receive up to 8% cashback rewards), investment, financial and trading services and also exclusive gift card purchases ranging from Amazon’s gift cards to IKEA’s and many other selected brands.</p>



<p>But let’s proceed in orderly fashion and add the necessary “historic” and context details first.</p>



<p>Crypto.com’s Logo — The Ethereum Lion</p>

<h3 id="brief-history"><strong>Brief History</strong></h3>



<p>Born in Hong Kong in 2016, Crypto.com is considered by many one of the main platforms to invest in&nbsp;<a href="https://atomicwallet.io/bitcoin-explained" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-ethereum-blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>&nbsp;or any of the other 50+ cryptocurrencies currently supported by the CRO ecosystem. The company was founded by Kris Marszalek and Bobby Bao — respectively the CEO and head of corporate development — both coming from the ranks of the now defunct company Ensogo, where they fulfilled the same actual roles. While the last Ensogo experience ended up abruptly and not without strains, both Marszalek and Bao boast a long curriculum with experiences and successes, not just from the business/commerce world (BeeCrazy, JD.com) but also from the banking/financial domain (Deloitte, Merrill Lynch, China Renaissance).</p>



<p>Additionally, among Crypto.com’s most notable, and experienced team members to name there is Rafael Melo as CFO (15 years in finance and risk compliance), Gary Or as CTO (engineer with 9+ years of experience in AI and Machine Learning), Eric Anziani (ex Goldman Sachs, McKinsey and Paypal) and Jason Lau as CISO (multi-award winning cybersecurity professional).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since its inception in 2016, the company has been growing steadily both in its ranks (now counting more that 290 employees) and in terms of partnerships (Kaiko, nopCommerce, BCVault, Cointracking, IDAXA to name a few), casting it in the Olympus of the most renowned projects in the crypto sphere to this day.</p>



<p>Kris Marszalek — Crypto.com’s CEO and Co-Founder</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="550"  height="525"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/output-onlinepngtools.png"  alt="Kris Marszalek — Crypto.com’s CEO and Co-Founder"  class="wp-image-34263"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/output-onlinepngtools.png 212w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/output-onlinepngtools.png 536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/output-onlinepngtools.png 550w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/output-onlinepngtools.png 1131w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/output-onlinepngtools.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/output-onlinepngtools.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/output-onlinepngtools.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/output-onlinepngtools.png 24w"  sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" ></figure>



<h3 id="crypto-com-value-proposition"><strong>Crypto.com Value Proposition</strong></h3>



<p>As hinted earlier above, the Crypto.com value proposition can be concisely condensed into 3 main core products :&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Trading</li><li>Payment Services</li><li>Financial Services</li></ul>



<p>Let’s delve deeper into each of these 3 directives.</p>



<h3 id="crypto-com-trading-services"><strong>Crypto.com Trading Services</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1024"  height="647"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_GBi_U-6XrlgGOmwJ89vNCQ.jpeg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34259"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_GBi_U-6XrlgGOmwJ89vNCQ.jpeg 1024w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_GBi_U-6XrlgGOmwJ89vNCQ-810x512.jpeg 810w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_GBi_U-6XrlgGOmwJ89vNCQ-300x190.jpeg 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_GBi_U-6XrlgGOmwJ89vNCQ-768x485.jpeg 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_GBi_U-6XrlgGOmwJ89vNCQ-380x240.jpeg 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_GBi_U-6XrlgGOmwJ89vNCQ-800x505.jpeg 800w"  sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" ></figure>



<p>The Crypto.com Exchange Main Page&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Trading services are offered mainly via the exchange. Now, while it is still possible to buy and sell cryptocurrencies via the Crypto.com integrated app, the latter currently lacks most of the basic and advanced trading features that the platform offers: limit orders and margin trading are not yet implemented in the app, which instead was initially designed to support the Card payment services, but also lending and borrowing. At the moment the Crypto.com team is working towards implementing derivatives going live and OTC trading, but an announcement on when these features will be going live has not yet been made public.</p>



<p>In order to be able to start trading on Crypto.com and interact with the exchange dashboard, users only need to sign up, fill the forms and pass simple KYC procedures. New users that sign up on Crypto.com via referral are eligible to receive a registration bonus (up to 50$), provided that the referred entrant fulfills the minimum staking requirement of 1000 CRO (or more) on the exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what does “staking on the exchange” mean when it comes to CRO?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1338"  height="626"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_8720o6i9IYMcDzE4t9xE3Q.png"  alt="CRO Staking Tiers — Rebates, Discounts and Bonuses"  class="wp-image-34260"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_8720o6i9IYMcDzE4t9xE3Q.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_8720o6i9IYMcDzE4t9xE3Q.png 1024w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_8720o6i9IYMcDzE4t9xE3Q.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_8720o6i9IYMcDzE4t9xE3Q.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_8720o6i9IYMcDzE4t9xE3Q.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_8720o6i9IYMcDzE4t9xE3Q.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_8720o6i9IYMcDzE4t9xE3Q.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_8720o6i9IYMcDzE4t9xE3Q.png 1338w"  sizes="(max-width: 1338px) 100vw, 1338px" ></figure>



<p>CRO Staking Tiers — Rebates, Discounts and Bonuses</p>



<p>Staking on the exchange gives concrete shape to CRO’s utility as a token, by granting users lower trading fees and rebates: users that stake at least 5000 CRO for 6 months on the exchange get access not only to discounted maker/taker trading fees (aka Crypto.com’s “Stake-to-Take Program”) but they can also earn 10% APY interest (paid daily) and have access to “The Syndicate” — a fund raising platform where, bi-weekly, some of the most famous crypto projects and their tokens are showcased, giving the chance to Crypto.com users to allocate their available CROs and receive a share of the showcased tokens at a 50% discount.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, in order to participate to Syndicate events and their allocation, users need to provide a minimum amount of CRO staked on their Crypto.com Exchange account and have traded the corresponding value in the past 30 days (see the sample chart below for reference).&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1314"  height="1054"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_mM4BWT34DV5lsBnW1pzLfQ.png"  alt="CRO Staking Maximum Allocation"  class="wp-image-34261"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_mM4BWT34DV5lsBnW1pzLfQ.png 252w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_mM4BWT34DV5lsBnW1pzLfQ.png 638w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_mM4BWT34DV5lsBnW1pzLfQ.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_mM4BWT34DV5lsBnW1pzLfQ.png 1346w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_mM4BWT34DV5lsBnW1pzLfQ.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_mM4BWT34DV5lsBnW1pzLfQ.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_mM4BWT34DV5lsBnW1pzLfQ.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_mM4BWT34DV5lsBnW1pzLfQ.png 1314w"  sizes="(max-width: 1314px) 100vw, 1314px" ></figure>



<p>* Please do note that the figures are subject to change dynamically with market conditions and CRO appreciation/depreciation</p>



<p>Each Syndicate staking tier has a maximum allocation cap, which can be increased only via the staking of more CROs on the Crypto.com’s exchange. By allocating more CRO tokens during the Syndicate events, users also increase the share of their commitment, which in turn boosts the amount of the featured token they will receive after the Syndicate will have completed. It’s important to note that CRO tokens allocated for the Syndicate — while awaiting for the final distribution — are locked for a week, so opportunity costs consideration come into play. Furthermore, the gains made by entering the syndicates are dependent on the number of participants, as well as the total amount of CROs allocated, which are therefore subject to variations each time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="768"  height="345"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_evRv3faRwNrdJaP1JTQZNA.png"  alt="Crypto.com"  class="wp-image-34262"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_evRv3faRwNrdJaP1JTQZNA.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_evRv3faRwNrdJaP1JTQZNA.png 1024w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_evRv3faRwNrdJaP1JTQZNA.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_evRv3faRwNrdJaP1JTQZNA.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_evRv3faRwNrdJaP1JTQZNA.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_evRv3faRwNrdJaP1JTQZNA.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_evRv3faRwNrdJaP1JTQZNA.png 380w"  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" ></figure>



<p>The Supercharger</p>



<p>Users that might be reluctant to stake tokens on the exchange – maybe due to the Syndicate’s stricter requirements to join in – can still turn their CRO holdings to the “Supercharger”. Quoted by Crypto.com as a “liquidity mining platform that allows users to deposit tokens in order to mine the most popular DeFi tokens”, the Supercharger is available both on the Crypto.com Exchange and App and has no entry prerequisites.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How does it work? Just like with the Syndicate, a featured token is “sponsored” by Crypto.com, this time for 30 days. During this period — aka the “Charging Period” — users can freely deposit/withdraw any amount of CRO tokens, as liquidity, into the Supercharger. Hourly snapshots of the CROs provided by each user are taken/captured and, at the end of the Charging Period, a proportional share of the user’s contribution is awarded to him/her. It’s worth highlighting two features about this tool:</p>



<p>I. Users are free to leave their assets deposited for some time (e.g. 7 days), then withdraw them, then re-deposit them, and so on, anytime. The final distribution will consider each depositing period as well as the amount of CRO provided by each user and withdrawing before the 30 days will still make the user eligible to get a part of the Supercharger rewards.</p>



<p>II. Just like the Supercharger requires 30 days “to charge”, the same concept is applied to the user’s rewards distribution: the interests earned will mature and be given out over the next 30 days after the charging period has ended (making the comprehensive charging period plus the post-charging a total of 60 days).</p>



<h3 id="crypto-com-s-payment-services"><strong>Crypto.com’s Payment Services</strong></h3>



<p>The Payment solutions provided by Crypto.com are declaredly meant to be the company’s leading service (as also stated in the whitepaper) and have definitely been driving user acquisition and adoption to the platform. Inside this category, it’s possible to enumerate two service lines: the Crypto.com Pay service and the MCO Visa Debit Card(now unofficially known by most as the CRO Visa Debit card, after the the discontinuation of the previous card-related MCO token).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1600"  height="890"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_Yri0Lu8ePeYfxydTJsGOEA.png"  alt="Crypto.com Pay with Gift Card"  class="wp-image-34264"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_Yri0Lu8ePeYfxydTJsGOEA.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_Yri0Lu8ePeYfxydTJsGOEA.png 920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_Yri0Lu8ePeYfxydTJsGOEA.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_Yri0Lu8ePeYfxydTJsGOEA.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_Yri0Lu8ePeYfxydTJsGOEA.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_Yri0Lu8ePeYfxydTJsGOEA.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_Yri0Lu8ePeYfxydTJsGOEA.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_Yri0Lu8ePeYfxydTJsGOEA.png 1600w"  sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" ></figure>



<ul><li>The Crypto.com Pay service prizes users with cashback for utilizing the Pay feature inside the Crypto.com App to send or transfer CRO to other Crypto.com members or by selecting CRO as the payment method to purchase directly from several selected retail partners or indirectly by buying gift cards (and receiving up to 10% cashback on several brands).&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  alt="" ></figure>



<p>Crypto.com Pay</p>



<ul><li>The MCO Card — which can be ordered via the Crypto.com app — is a contactless wireless metal Visa Debit Card that offers several advantages to its owners. Again, users are required to undergo a successful KYC procedure and stake a specific amount of CROs to order the card, willingly locking them in for at least 6 months. It’s worth noting that the CRO tokens staked on the exchange (that provide rebates/discounted fees/syndicate benefits) do not cumulate with the CROs staked on the app for the card. Therefore users that already locked CRO tokens on the exchange will need to stake another amount of CRO to get their MCO card in the app, as the two are completely distinct, fulfill different roles and provide different benefits.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  alt="" ></figure>



<p>MCO Visa Cards — Staking Tiers, Rewards &amp; Benefits</p>



<p>Another aspects that deserves mention is the fact that Crypto.com has a referral program in place to bring new leads to the MCO Visa cards as well as to motivate current users to actively share these opportunities within their social circles. Referred users that order the MCO Card by using a valid referral code and then by staking the corresponding sum of CROs, will immediately receive $25. And, in equal measure, that same amount that goes to the referred person will be awarded to the referral as well.</p>



<p>The MCO Visa Card rewards &amp; benefits vary with the entity of the CRO staked on the app and cards are filled with perks ranging from cashbacks, full monthly reimbursement of Spotify, Netflix and Amazon subscriptions, rebates on Airbnb and Expedia purchases, free airport Lounge access, weekly awarded bonus interests calculated on the card-staked CROs and even a bombastic Private Jet Partnership for Obsidian Black MCO card owners — the high-end, top of the line among MCO cards.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  alt="" ></figure>



<p>The Complete Set of MCO Visa Debit Cards</p>



<p>So, we’ve seen that the CRO token powers both the Payment and the Visa card ecosystems and while I’ve already mentioned that CRO can be used as the source token to pay – using the Crypto.com Pay service – I must add that the cashback rewards are also paid in CRO instantly, after any eligible purchase.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="crypto-com-s-financial-services"><strong>Crypto.com’s Financial Services</strong></h3>



<p>The company’s financial products represent Crypto.com main source of revenue together with the exchange trading services and include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Crypto Earn — a service where users can deposit any among the 50+ tokens supported on the app and earn interest. The depositing options differ in time (from flexible/immediately liquid terms to a maximum of 3 months vesting time) and — clearly – the longer your staking period, the higher the APY that will be calculated on the deposited capital . Moreover, differently from what happens on the exchange, Crypto Earn interests are paid on a weekly basis.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  alt="" ></figure>



<p>Crypto Earn — CRO Staking Comparison</p>



<ul><li>Crypto Credit — this is Crypto.com’s financial solution to instantly lending/borrowing money with no deadlines attached and no credit check. It allows users to monetize some of their assets by holding them in escrow and receiving an equivalent sum in a stablecoin of choice among TUSD, PAX, USDC or USDT. At the moment of this writing, the currently depositable assets include CRO, BTC, XRP, ETH, LTC, EOS and XLM.&nbsp;</li><li>DeFi Swap represents Crypto.com’s take on Decentralized Swap Protocols. Via this application users can swap tokens (just like they would when using Uniswap or Balancer), provide liquidity to ERC-20 token pairs’ liquidity pools and earn interests for doing so (in the form of a percentage when any swapping occurs on that pair). Swapping and providing liquidity on DeFi Swap is no different than doing the same operation on Uniswap. The only main difference here, compared to other similar DeFi protocols, is tied to the possibility (again) of staking CRO tokens: by supplying a greater amount of CROs and for a longer period of time (up to a 4 years timeframe) liquidity providers can get a boost on the yield earned for providing the pool assets. Furthermore, new partner pools are periodically sponsored and supplying liquidity to these advertised selected pools is incentivized by Crypto.com in the form of token airdrops.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  alt="" ></figure>



<p>Crypto Earn &amp; Crypto Credit</p>



<h3 id="perspectives-and-takeaway"><strong>Perspectives and Takeaway</strong></h3>



<p>An overview of the CRO token and Crypto.com’s value offering would not be complete without contextualizing the pros and cons of the features, services and products that the platform is offering, especially in light of the most recent news revolving around the CRO ecosystem as a whole.</p>



<p>Despite the actual and sustained push of Bitcoin and Ethereum, in the past weeks, Crypto.com’s token (CRO) price fell gradually at first, then quite abruptly (after the 2nd week of October), from $0.15 per token to more than half of that value, establishing itself at around the $0.06 mark. The dip was probably aided by the announcement of the MCO-CRO swap (initially made public in August and officially completed on September 2nd) and the sharp cut of Exchange and Earn interest rates on Crypto.com’s exchange and app. More recently, the update to the current card staking rates occurred, establishing the actual increased amount of CRO tokens required to obtain higher tier cards.</p>



<p>Just as these news hit the headlines, many early Crypto.com and MCO adopters were reportedly dissatisfied by the company’s choices, which were addressed as the main factors leading to the substantial token “dip”. Nonetheless Crypto.com still managed to grow its user base achieving the impressive milestone of 5 million users, symbolizing that adoption is nevertheless much underway.</p>



<p>Adding to the above insight, the MCO Visa cards still represent the tip of the diamond in Crypto.com’s value proposition and maintain huge palatability, despite the growing competition in the cryptocurrency cards market (especially from major players such as Swipe, Binance Card, as well as new ones that are now staging their moves like for example Plutus, Eidoo or QuiverX). It can’t be underestimated the fact that the ample, diversified Card tiers haven’t stopped attracting a wide user audience, ranging from users who prefer a more humble 1% cashback, no-staking required, freely shipped Midnight Blue card, to more affluent, demanding customers that will appreciate a richly overcharged (with perks and an astounding 8% cashback) Obsidian Black VIP card.</p>



<p>Then Syndicate events, the Supercharger and DeFi Swap keep sustaining and adding more value to the CRO token, by providing users with a plethora of possibilities to earn and capitalize on their cryptocurrency investments. In all this, the CRO token plays the main role as the fundamental asset to even being able to access these tools and boosting payments, financial and trading related to the ecosystem, thus very pragmatically closing in towards true real world utility, aimed to both retail, institutional stakeholders and new future partners as well.</p>

<p>What’s coming next — Crypto.com Roadmap</p>



<p>Finally there’s a lot more coming down the road, with the next announced step being CRO Main Net Launch, planned for Q4 2020/Q1 2021, which will partially “detach” CRO dependency as an ERC-20 token from Ethereum. This will potentially imply lower gas fees (at least compared to the current ones) and streamlined transactions. The focus will then switch towards the shipment of MCO Debit Cards at a global level, direct partnership with key international players, DeFi Lending/Borrowing and DeFi Cards going live, as well as the aforementioned “exchange upgrades” with the coming of Derivatives and OTC. So many ambitious targets, which play along the team’s vision.&nbsp;</p>

Crypto.com will undoubtedly play a role, helping to shape and push the future of cryptocurrency forwards and the brilliant team behind CRO will surely do its part in the coming days, months and years, now already marked by the symptoms of a long awaited bull-run.</p>

<p>Started as a &#8220;prank&#8221; cryptocurrency, Dogecoin managed to hit the headlines right after Gamestop&#8217;s (GME) rally, gaining the Reddit community full support.</p>



<p>This article will try to outline the history and vantage points of the most famous dog-friendly (pun intended) meme coin in the cryptocurrency world, which both Reddit investors &amp; Elon Musk want to &#8220;fly to the moon.&#8221;</p>



<h3 id="a-shibe-star-is-born"><strong>A Shibe Star is Born…</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dogecoin-born.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33910" ></figure>



<p>For those readers who are well-versed with history &#8211; especially with the Medieval and Renaissance periods of the Venetian Republic &#8211; it may be worth noting that the coin&#8217;s name &#8220;Doge&#8221; is entirely unrelated. Instead, Dogecoin pays homage to what is probably one of the most persistent and resilient memes in web lore history.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image8.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33375" ></figure>



<p>Born as a seeming malapropism of the word &#8220;dog,&#8221; the Doge is a cute Shiba Inu (commonly called &#8220;Shibe&#8221; in the crypto space) that&#8217;s almost always depicted with a vaguely gobsmacked expression. This dog is often coupled with some vignette/interior monologue, whose selected characters&#8217; font is strictly in Comic Sans.</p>



<p>For the sake of completeness, the Shiba Inu, who&#8217;s lent its expressive muzzle to the internet memes that are raging throughout the Web,&nbsp;<strong>does</strong>&nbsp;genuinely exist. Its name is Kabosu and bears quite a heroic background and past: he is one of the few Shibas, in his litter, having survived a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppy_mill" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8216;Puppy Mill&#8217; ordeal</a>, before being rescued from almost spelled death by Japanese nursery school Atsuko Sato in 2008.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image4-1.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33386" ></figure>



<p>Two years after, Sato decided to share some pictures, of her and Kabosu, on the Web. It was one of these fatal shots that managed to catch the Internet community&#8217;s attention, decreeing the meme&#8217;s birth that&#8217;s been raging both in the crypto space, especially in the past years, weeks, days.<br></p>



<p>(By the way, despite more than ten years have passed since that fateful picture having been uploaded on the Web, it seems Kabosu is still alive and well, having reached a venerable age by now. Wow. Much Reverence).</p>



<h3 id="d-is-for-dogecoin-nbsp"><strong>Ð is for Ðogecoin&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/d-is-for-dogecoin.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33921" ></figure>



<p>The definitive twist came when Billy Markus, an IBM engineer, and Jackson Palmer, an Australian software engineer and employee of the Adobe The definitive twist came when Billy Markus, an IBM engineer, and Jackson Palmer, an Australian software engineer and employee of the Adobe Systems Marketing Department (one of the biggest tech firms in the world at the time) conceived &#8211; at least initially &#8211; the pranky idea of creating a crypto coin that would combine two of the most discussed topics on the Internet: cryptocurrencies and dogs. «Invest in Dogecoin. I am pretty sure it will be the next big thing», that&#8217;s what Markus had tweeted in what could be considered a moment of boredom. The joking tweet and reference to Dogecoin &#8211; which still had not yet been created by Markus and Palmer &#8211; was meant to target/criticize when new cryptocurrencies were being launched by the day, many of which had no intrinsic value or solid fundamentals, according to Palmer.</p>



<p>But we all know that fate loves irony, and that&#8217;s how a tweet about a crypto coin that was meant to be a prank managed instead to gain a lot of attention, traction &amp; followers. The same followers then encouraged Palmer and Markus to implement Dogecoin&#8217;s creation. Shortly after the tweet, dogecoin.com was born, and the website received more than 1 million visitors in the first month since its initial launch.</p>



<p>Palmer&#8217;s tweet was then taken seriously by many crypto investors and fans, who decided, from that moment on, to fully embrace &#8220;the Doge&#8221; as one of their favorite cryptocurrencies, acclaiming it as &#8220;the next big thing&#8221; in the crypto-financial sector.<br>I</p>



<p>n the wake of this success, Palmer and his associate decided to build upon the public acclaim and validation by purchasing the dogecoin.com domain and creating the primogenitor Doge&#8217;s &#8220;viral logo,&#8221; as we know it today.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image5.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33397" ></figure>



<p>The project was put to fruition in a short time but, despite Palmer and Markus riding the wave, they seemingly still considered it a &#8220;game&#8221;: therefore, the project cruised forward placidly &#8211; until social news aggregator Reddit and its community decide to &#8220;adopt&#8221; the $DOGE. Dogecoin&#8217;s subreddit rapidly reached peak subscription numbers and activity levels, thanks to implementing the so-called &#8220;Reddit Tip Bot.&#8221; This tool hugely boosted Dogecoin&#8217;s adoption by rewarding Reddit&#8217;s most active users and original content creators, and &#8211; in a concise amount of time &#8211; Dogecoin&#8217;s circulation bloomed and blossomed: from then on, virtually every Reddit user started earning and collecting his/her $DOGEs and the &#8220;viral spiral&#8221; of the internet meme &amp; crypto communities took over.</p>



<p>Since then, many initiatives have been launched by Dogecoin&#8217;s community of fans &#8211; some crazier than others, some audacious, some quite noble. These included the crowdfunding to help the Jamaican bobsled team join the Soči Winter Olympics, the Doge4Water initiative to help collect donations to build a well in the Tana river basin in Kenya Dogecoin&#8217;s NASCAR sponsorship banner over driver Josh Wise&#8217;s car.</p>



<p>And all these eventful happenings came to be way before Elon Musk &#8220;got elected&#8221; as Dogecoin&#8217;s CEO.</p>



<h3 id="all-hail-the-new-ceo"><strong>“All Hail The New CEO!”</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/elon-musk-dogecoin-ceo.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33932" ></figure>



<p>The last sentence in the previous paragraph deserves some clarification, especially for anyone that, quite understandably, knows Elon Musk is renownedly Tesla and SpaceX CEO, but not Dogecoin&#8217;s. When did that happen?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image9.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33408" ></figure>



<p>Elon Musk&#8217;s &#8220;first contact&#8221; with Dogecoin&#8217;s creator Jackson Palmer probably dated back to September 2018 and was unrelated to $DOGE &#8211;&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1041572165898792961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1041572165898792961%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fhardfork%2F2018%2F09%2F17%2Fmusk-twitter-scambots-dogecoin%2F" rel="noreferrer noopener">Musk asked Palmer&#8217;s aid</a>&nbsp;to get rid of malicious bots impersonating him after a cryptocurrency scam bot virus was raging throughout Twitter. Palmer was called to arms &#8211; or so to speak &#8211; having developed a script in the past that would help solve the long-standing issue.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image3-1.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33419" ></figure>



<p>The change in attitude and the internet culture&#8217;s validation, tributed by meme and crypto communities to Elon Musk as Dogecoin&#8217;s CEO, dates back to a 2019 &#8220;prank-styled,&#8221; renowned poll, launched by Dogecoin&#8217;s official Twitter account on April Fools&#8217; day, which saw&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/dogecoin/status/1112756919951859712?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elon emerge victorious as the surveyed-elected and undisputed leader</a>&nbsp;of the most famous dog coin of the Web, getting the most preferences (over 4,000 thousand votes) and sympathies over notable opposing candidates, such as Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum founder), Marshall Hayner (Metal Pay&#8217;s Founder and CEO) and Charlie Lee (Litecoin&#8217;s founder).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image6-1.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33430" ></figure>



<p>Musk was already known as a tech futurist and paper money disbeliever &#8211; who in past comments, described BTC as &#8220;a brilliant thing&#8221; &#8211; and, in response to the poll, contributed to the hype&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1113009339743100929?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener">by commenting</a>&nbsp;and almost accepting the &#8220;public nomination&#8221;:&nbsp;</p>



<p>«Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It&#8217;s pretty cool.»</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image14.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33441" ></figure>



<p>Musk was also apparently very proud of the crypto community’s Musk was also apparently very proud of the crypto community&#8217;s nomination and the faith he was entrusted with. Following the fateful event, he even changed his Twitter header bio to &#8220;CEO of Dogecoin,&#8221;&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1113173498384441344?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener">followed by a tweet with a picture of a Shiba Inu with the caption &#8220;Dogecoin Rulz</a>.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image2.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33452" ></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image1-1.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33463" ></figure>



<p>That&#8217;s how it all began, and many would controversially agree that Musk took his newly appointed role very seriously, reminding DOGE&#8217;s fans, from time to time, that he&#8217;s duly supporting the coin with tweets and pranky (sometimes trollish) memes and promoting the most famous Shiba Inu in the world.</p>



<h3 id="the-beginning-of-a-new-paradigm"><strong>The Beginning of a New Paradigm?</strong></h3>



<p>Since 2013, almost a decade has passed. Yet, Dogecoin has never been so popular.</p>



<p>In the past years, several viral campaigns have tried to boost the adoption of $DOGE to reach dollar parity. In 2019 and 2020, it was the turn of a user-based campaign on TikTok &#8211; and at the time $ DOGE&#8217;s value was just around 0,01 dollars, nothing compared to actual prices, which witness Elon Musk &#8220;at the helm of the Dogecoin&#8217;s moon ship.&#8221;</p>



<p>Elon Musk&#8217;s active twitter involvement, especially in recent times, has largely contributed to Dogecoin&#8217;s growth: significant surges in $ DOGE&#8217;s price have occurred each time &#8220;his CEO&#8221; resolved to tweet his appreciation to the world.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image7-1.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33474" ></figure>



<p>It also seems that Elon&#8217;s frequent engagement helped drawing the attention to Dogecoin, not only of the fans, the investors, and the media but also other celebrities, ranging from names such as&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/SnoopDogg/status/1358141965930426368?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener">rap star Snoop Dogg</a>,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/genesimmons/status/1358992775937548290?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener">American songwriter and record producer Gene Simmons</a>&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ANGELAWHITE/status/1345197408448204800?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener">pornstar Angela White</a>, who have spent honeyed, sweet words for the coin, fueling and boosting its price to unprecedented, sky-high levels.</p>



<p>Adding to the narrative, $DOGE also managed to gain the attention of the r/WallStreetBets Reddit community, which &#8211; after&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2021/01/30/gamestop-wont-stop-robinhood-cheats-musk-tweets-hodlers012430" rel="noreferrer noopener">the $GME, $AMC, and Robinhood app uproar</a>&nbsp;&#8211; ingeniously refocused the attention towards Dogecoin, meeting with a more than favorable astral conjunction, which saw in Elon Musk tweets its most shiny starlight supporting the recent price boosts.</p>



<p>On a more general note, many would also argue that the recent Robinhood, GameStop, and Dogecoin events managed to stir the waters profoundly and raise the awareness of both many non-crypto &amp; crypto investors with regards to innovation, reliability, neutrality, and decentralization safety that only blockchain technology can bring, and that traditional finance &#8211; more often than not &#8211; lacks.</p>



<p>In tying in all these happenings together, this analysis couldn&#8217;t possibly be complete without mentioning&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.coindesk.com/tesla-invests-1-5b-in-bitcoin-plans-to-accept-crypto-payments" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elon Musk&#8217;s recent Tesla $1,5 billion acquisition of Bitcoin</a>. In perfect accordance with the extravagant CEO&#8217;s style, the move was preceded by several alluding tweets &#8230;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image10.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33485" ></figure>



<p>… then by the addition of the #Bitcoin hashtag and emoji&nbsp;<strong><em>₿</em></strong>&nbsp;on his bio…</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image12.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33496" ></figure>



<p>…. and, finally, by an official announcement, which reverberated through the media channels throughout the world, sparkling criticisms (among traditional finance vets) and plauds (among crypto supporters) in almost equal measure.</p>



<p>In many ways, the events laid out «the fundamental question» again: does crypto represent a much-needed, natural evolution to help assist and govern the future of our economic, financial, political, and &#8211; maybe partially &#8211; social systems?</p>



<h3 id="8230-to-be-continued"><strong>&#8230;To Be Continued?</strong></h3>



<p>Final Doge note/trivia: on February 15th, Dogecoin&#8217;s value saw a substantial price devaluation, right after Elon Musk criticized the extremely uneven $DOGE distribution, inviting the significant holders to sell a significant share of their coins holding.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image13.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33507" ></figure>



<p>Various analytics sources show that just 100 addresses hold more than 70% of the whole $DOGE supply. Therefore, the vast majority of $DOGEs are concentrated in the hands of a single holder, while the next ten major holders own more than 50% of the total supply.</p>



<p>Several hours after the tweet, Dogecoin&#8217;s price fell to $0,048, bouncing back to $0,06$ after a general market recovery. That was probably Elon Musk&#8217;s only tweet that supposedly caused a reduction in $ DOGE&#8217;s price.</p>

<p>Without any pretense of completeness, the above was a concise synopsis of how one of the most extravagant, yet undeniably brilliant, business personalities of our times &amp; one of the most loved meme cryptocurrencies in the crypto space managed to get acquainted, intertwine fates, and somehow shape many of the most eventful, recent happenings in the cryptocurrency universe.</p>



<p>Many fateful readers would recognize most of the previously described Elon-Doge events as &#8220;signs&#8221; &#8211; part of a broader «<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect" rel="noreferrer noopener">Butterfly Effect</a>» design &#8211; that would lay the path to the «cryptocurrency-as-the-new-paradigm» future, with Elon Musk playing the Deus-Ex-Machina role.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether that is something that will be true or not, it will surely be worth watching closely. And in any case, the chances are that Shibe will be remembered as the catalyst of the future, unfurling events. In retrospect, it *<strong>will</strong>* be inevitable.</p>
