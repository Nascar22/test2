<h1 id="what-is-bitcoin-btc"><strong>What is Bitcoin (BTC)</strong></h1>



<p>Bitcoin Price Prediction 2021 &#8211; Anaylsed. Bitcoin is the most valuable cryptocurrency or digital asset in the world. It dates back to 2008, while in 2009, it became accessible. Bitcoin is a digital resource created to ease the transfer of funds. Most importantly, it enhances a third-party free transaction process. Also, users do not need to disclose their identities while making payments. All transactions across the Bitcoin blockchain are irreversible and cannot be undone.</p>



<p>Currently, Bitcoin sits at a market cap of over $600 million out of the total $1 trillion for the crypto market in general. Therefore, Bitcoin is the largest and most valuable asset in the crypto market. According to Bitcoin News, Bitcoin&#8217;s current price is about $33,800. BTC&#8217;s maximum supply is 21 million, while its circulating supply is over 18,616,000. Other crypto coins also claim to have a decentralized system, but Bitcoin remains the first-ever digital asset ever to exist.</p>

<h3 id="btc-price-prediction-for-btc-2021"><strong>BTC Price Prediction for BTC 2021</strong></h3>



<p>At the end of 2020, the Bitcoin coin price went as high as crossing the $30,000 mark. The big bull run went on till the beginning of 2021, and BTC price crossed $40,000. This price is about a 248% increase in Bitcoin price USD from 2020.</p>



<p>Afterward, the hype and media were all over it, and everyone started to carry the Bitcoin news. Many were grateful to have bought the dip, while some people expressed their regrets for not buying early. However, not everyone was optimistic about the Bitcoin price at the end of this year. Some analysts still see a sharp drop in 2021, just like it happened after the 2017 bull run.</p>

<p><strong>Mike McGlone Bitcoin Price Prediction 2021</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Mike-McGlone-Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-20210A.png"  alt="Mike McGlone on Bitcoin Prediction."  class="wp-image-32968" ></figure>



<p>While speaking in an interview, Mike McGlone from Bloomberg stressed the reason for the Bitcoin surge. &#8220;<em>What I&#8217;m worried about – looking at its performance, Bitcoin is potentially indicative of the future. Next year too, it could add a zero to the back of the number</em>.&#8221;</p>



<p>Likewise, he said. Bitcoin&#8217;s current price keeps increasing because of its limited supply and institutional investments.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Before, it had retail investors now institutional investors – limited supply and increased demand is picking up. The mark is very positive.&#8221;&nbsp;</em>&#8211; Mike McGlone.</p>



<p>Mike&#8217;s Bitcoin price prediction stands around $170,000 at the end of 2021.</p>



<h3 id="robert-kiyosaki-bitcoin-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Robert Kiyosaki Bitcoin Price Prediction 2021</strong></h3>

<p>The author of the best-selling &#8220;Rich Dad Poor Dad&#8221; says institutional money will push BTC higher. Kiyosaki also encouraged buyers to enter around $20,000 as $50,000 is the next target for Bitcoin price USD.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Glad I bought Bitcoin. The next stop is $50k. Walls of institutional money coming 2021. Buy below $20k………….&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Kiyosaki is likewise an investor in real estate and precious metals.</p>



<h3 id="mike-novogratz-bitcoin-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Mike Novogratz Bitcoin Price Prediction 2021</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Mike-Novogratz-Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-20210A.png"  alt="Mike Novogratz on the Price Prediction"  class="wp-image-32935" ></figure>



<p>In November 2020, Mike Novogratz, founder of Galaxy Digital, made a tweet predicting Bitcoin value in 2021. He predicted while advising Maise Williams, a star from the famous &#8216;Game of Thrones.&#8217;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;I bought more $BTC last night at $15800. It is going to $20k and $65k. The network effect has taken over. I see tons of new buyers, and there is very little supply. It&#8217;s an easier trade here than at $11k.&nbsp;</em><strong><em>YES</em></strong><em>, buy it.&#8221;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Novogratz sees the Bitcoin coin price at $65,000 at the end of 2021.</p>



<h3 id="simon-dedic-bitcoin-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Simon Dedic Bitcoin Price Prediction 2021</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Simon-Dedic-Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-20210A.png"  alt="Simon Dedic on Bitcoin Price Prediction "  class="wp-image-32946" ></figure>



<p>Simon Dedic, the co-founder of Blockfyre, a cryptoanalysis company, predicted that the Bitcoin coin price could touch $150,000.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;In 2017, you could have bought any altcoin, and it was a good investment. IMO, this won&#8217;t happen again. However, I still believe that the bull run will return and pump a few solids out there&#8221;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Afterward, he gave his predictions on several crypto assets giving $BTC a potential $150,000 price.</p>



<h3 id="willy-woo-bitcoin-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Willy Woo Bitcoin Price Prediction 2021</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Willy-Woo-Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-20210A.png"  alt="Simon Dedic Bitcoin Price Prediction 2021"  class="wp-image-32957" ></figure>



<p>Famous on-chain analyst Willy Woo says in a Twitter thread that he is interested in &#8220;holding&#8221; BTC as he has never been so bullish for 2021. Woo said,&nbsp;<em>&#8220;My Top Model suggesting $200k per BTC by the end of 2021 looks conservative. $300k is not out of the question.&#8221;</em></p>



<p><em>He continues – &#8220;I&#8217;ve never been so bullish for 2021. This re-accumulation phase coincides with spot market inventory depletion roughly 2x longer and deeper than the last cycle. It will send BTC.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Willy Woo is sure that the Bitcoin price USD will be up to $200,000 in 2021.</p>



<p>Likewise, Citibank analyst Tom Fitzpatrick gave his Bitcoin price prediction. He said the asset would trade at $318,000 by the end of 2021. Tom admitted that painful corrections would follow the unthinkable rallies. Meanwhile, he said that Bitcoin was the new gold with fewer restrictions.</p>



<h3 id="bitcoin-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Bitcoin Price Prediction 2021</strong></h3>



<p>There are several reasons why investors can be bullish on Bitcoin predictions. Between 2020 and now, a good number of institutional investors and hedge funds have bought into Bitcoin. Popular mobile software provider MicroStrategy bought BTC worth $650 million in December 2020. Currently, the firm holds about 70,470 Bitcoins, equivalent to more than $2.4 billion.</p>



<p>Similarly, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has the most significant Bitcoin investment so far. The company holds some 572,644 Bitcoins, which is about 2% of BTC&#8217;s total supply. Grayscale Investments has over $21 billion in Bitcoin. Likewise, Grayscale also runs the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund. This hedge-fund too exposes investors to digital assets such as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Meanwhile, as of January 2021, 81.6% of the fund is invested in Bitcoin alone. As a result, about 7,036 BTC worth $279 million is held by the fund.</p>



<p>Other financial institutions like the CoinShares Group, London-based Ruffer Investment Company, and more have also bought BTC with millions of dollars. Moreover, world-leading asset manager BlackRock recently showed its interest in Bitcoin Futures investments.</p>



<p>It is imperative to note that institutional investors are coin &#8220;HODLERS.&#8221; They did not buy BTC for circulation but to lock it up till further notice. So, there is bound to be a reduction in the circulating supply of Bitcoin. Limited supply and an increase in demand breed a bullish market. We will not be surprised then to see BTC predictions fulfill and one Bitcoin sold for $100,000.</p>



<h3 id="bitcoin-price-prediction-2025"><strong>Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025</strong></h3>



<p>From now till 2025, BTC price is expected to surge very high. As a result of multiple streams of institutional investments, Bitcoin supply will become scarcer. Thus, the law of demand and supply will come into play and push BTC price to a massive high.</p>



<p>Apart from a correction, other things might happen that might drive Bitcoin&#8217;s current price lower. If countries make laws against cryptocurrencies, this might cause bad news. Also, hacking of exchanges and selling pressure might cause roadblocks for BTC. However, in the long run, any of these might never happen. Even if it does happen, it might have no adverse effect on Bitcoin value.</p>



<p>Therefore, by 2025, we expect a six-figure price per BTC.</p>



<h3 id="verdict-on-bitcoin-predictions"><strong>Verdict on Bitcoin Predictions</strong></h3>



<p>No doubt, Bitcoin is the most valuable digital asset in the world. With Bitcoin&#8217;s current price and its market cap value, it has over 60% dominance on the crypto market. Therefore, Bitcoin is an investment that will always be worth it. Like the Stack-to-Flow model and other financial analysts suggest, a limited supply will drive BTC price above $100,000.</p>



<p>Bitcoin is a safe investment for buyers. Many investors are buying BTC to ensure their money doesn&#8217;t lose value to inflation. No matter the&nbsp;<strong>Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt</strong>, Bitcoin value always increases. Thus, this is a good asset for every crypto trader in 2021.</p>



<p>To buy BTC, you can make use of the Atomic Wallet Interface. Atomic Wallet provides an easy and secure payment process with your bank card.</p>



<h3 id="how-to-buy-bitcoin"><strong>How to Buy Bitcoin</strong></h3>

<h4 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h4>



<p>This article is to provide predictions of BTC value at the end of 2021 and by 2025. It is subject to the views of different cryptocurrency analysts and investors. This article is not financial advice. Crypto trading is risky. Therefore, traders are encouraged to make use of proper risk management.</p>



<p>Ethereum Price Prediction &amp; Forecast 2021</p>



<h3 id="will-ethereum-eth-price-rise-or-fall-in-2021"><strong>Will Ethereum (ETH) price rise or fall in 2021?</strong></h3>



<p>Since the beginning of 2021, Ethereum price has gone up by over 85%. Ethereum has broken above the $1400 resistance zone and recently hit the $1500 milestone. Thus, ETH is set for new highs this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ETH price is also subject to higher levels due to Ethereum 2.0 launch and more extensive DeFi adoption. Ethereum 2.0 was launched close to the end of 2020. Meanwhile, over 3 million ETH currently worth $4.2 billion is locked in the project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So far, Defi projects are gaining higher ground. UniSwap is on top of the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) ecosystem with $23.3 billion. Remember, Ethereum is an underlying asset for decentralized finance. About 7.21 million Ethereum is locked in Defi. Thus, the more Defi projects gain ground, the higher this will push Ethereum price.</p>



<p>Since January 4, Ethereum&#8217;s price has not gone below the $1,000 mark. Thus, providing us an optimistic Ethereum price prediction. There are massive investments in Defi and bullish moves by Ethereum. We can safely predict that Ethereum&#8217;s price will close above $2,000 by the end of 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://preprod.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/validator_atom3.png"  alt="ATOM Validators cover"  class="wp-image-32318" ></figure>



<p>ATOM is the staking token of the Cosmos Hub and represents the right to participate in the Hub. One can participate by voting, delegating, or validating and can be a delegator or validator. Delegators can put their ATOM under one or several validators. There is a need to know how to choose a validator, the benefits, and risks involved in staking it.</p>



<p>Independent blockchains are connected by a network known as Cosmos. The Cosmos Hub is a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain that relies on validators for securing the network and is founded upon Tendermint. The role of validators is to run a full-node and broadcast votes by participating in consensus. A program that fully validates the blocks and transactions of a blockchain is a full-node. The only staking token of the Cosmos Hub is called ATOM. ATOM owners have the right to participate, and in exchange, they earn inflationary block rewards and transaction fees.</p>



<p>It is different from a light-node that can only process block headers and a small number of transactions. One needs more resources to run a full-node than a light-node. Validators must run full-node. Practically speaking, running full-node is running an up-to-date and uncompromised software version without any downtime.</p>



<p>ATOM holders who cannot or do not want to run validators are known as Delegators. They can delegate ATOM to validators and get a share of their revenue and risks. In case the validator misbehaves, the delegator is partially responsible, and the earnings get slashed in proportion to their stake. Delegators are accountable for choosing validators and are being assumed to monitor the activities of the validators actively.</p>



<p>Validators receive revenue by committing new blocks in the blockchain. They are also expected to vote on proposals as a means of participating in governance.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-choose-an-atom-validator-in-atomic"><br>How To Choose An ATOM Validator In Atomic</h2>



<p>The process of staking ATOM with Atomic Wallet is not hard. You can bond your ATOM to a validator in less than a minute. Have a look at our step-to-step guide on how to do it from your Atomic wallet.</p>



<p>Simply download and install the app and follow these instructions.</p>



<ol><li>Open your Atomic Wallet.</li><li>Buy ATOM. You can buy it with your credit card or exchange with other cryptocurrencies already in the wallet.</li><li>Click on ATOM on the coin list.</li><li>Click stake.</li></ol>



<p>Once you click stake, you will see the staking interface, available balance, and information on your staked and unstaked ATOM and rewards. If the information is correct, you can proceed by clicking stake.</p>



<ol><li>Choose or change your validator by clicking on the name and see your annual earnings. Once you are satisfied with the information, proceed by clicking stake.</li><li>You are done. All you need to do now is wait for your rewards. You can withdraw your rewards to your address by clicking claim.</li></ol>



<p>Since delegators share the revenue and risks with validators, they need to be careful when choosing validators. Delegators choose validators according to their subjective criteria that include:</p>



<ul><li>The number of self-delegated ATOM: When choosing a validator, it is better to get one with many self-delegated ATOM. That is because they have a higher stake and will be more responsible when transacting.</li><li>The number of delegated ATOM: When a large number of delegated ATOM is seen on a validator&#8217;s profile, it means that the community trusts them. However, it also means that the validator is a bigger target for cybercriminals. They also decrease the process of decentralizing the network.</li><li>Commission rate: Delegators can choose validators with high commission rates since they share the validator&#8217;s revenue.</li><li>Track record: Delegators need to look at the validator’s track record. It includes past proposal votes, seniority, average uptime, and how often they compromise the node.</li></ul>



<p>Other than this, validators might need to have a website address included in their resume. Validators need to build their reputation for them to attract delegators. One way they can do this is through having third-party audits. However, it is important to note that the Tendermint team will not approve or participate in any audits.</p>



<h2 id="responsibilities-of-delegators"><br>Responsibilities Of Delegators</h2>



<p>Being a delegator requires one to be active. Here are the primary responsibilities when it comes to being a delegator.</p>



<ul><li>Delegators need to exercise due diligence when choosing validators since they are directly affected by the validators&#8217; actions.</li><li>Delegators should continuously monitor the validator after delegating their ATOM. Doing this will ensure the validator behaves well, and their ATOM do not get compromised and get slashed due to their misconduct.</li><li>If the delegators are not happy with their current validators, they can immediately switch to different validators at no charge.</li><li>Delegators are expected to participate in governance by voting on proposals. The voting power of a delegator is directly proportional to their ATOM stake. If delegators do not exercise their voting rights, their vote is considered the same as their validators. When all delegators vote, they can act as a counterbalance to the validators.</li></ul>



<h2 id="types-of-validators"><br>Types of Validators</h2>



<p>After a validator is established, there are three states a validator can exist:</p>



<ul><li>In the validator set: Here, the validator is active and participates in consensus. The validator earns rewards, and they can be slashed if there is any misbehavior.</li><li>Jailed: Here, the validator is in jail (outside the validator set) because of misbehaving. If the validator is &#8220;jailed&#8221; due to being online for a while, they can send an un-jail transaction to be allowed back into the validator set. The validator cannot be unjailed if there is a case of double signing.</li><li>Unbounded: This state occurs when the validator is not active and is not signing blocks. It is possible to delegate ATOM to the validator, but they cannot be slashed. It is easy to delegate from an unbounded validator to a different one.</li></ul>



<h2 id="benefits-and-risks-of-staking-atom"><br>Benefits And Risks Of Staking ATOM</h2>



<p>Like any other investment, staking ATOM has its benefits and risks.</p>



<h3 id="benefits"><br>Benefits</h3>



<p>There are two main benefits to validators and delegators when it comes to staking ATOM.</p>



<ul><li>They can earn block provisions, which is revenue paid when new ATOM tokens are created. They encourage delegators to stake their ATOM.</li><li>There are various transaction fees when delegators transfer their ATOM on the Cosmos hub. The fees are payable in any currency whitelisted by the Cosmos Hub&#8217;s governance and then distributed to ATOM owners in proportion to their stake.</li><li>Validators receive commissions based on the total ATOM stake. Delegators are responsible for paying the commission before they get any revenue from the validator.</li></ul>



<h3 id="risks"><br>Risks</h3>



<p>There are risks involved when it comes to staking ATOM.</p>



<ul><li>Staked ATOM can be locked, and retrieving them requires a 3-week unbinding period.</li><li>Also, if a validator misbehaves, part of their stake can be slashed. Two conditions need to be fulfilled for slashing to occur:</li><li>Double signing: If a validator signs two different accounts with the same ID, they can get slashed. At the moment, the slashing is 5% of the staked ATOM.</li><li>Downtime: When the validator does not sign a pre-commit, downtime happens. For instance, if a validator fails to sign 9,500 blocks in the 10,000 block window, 0.01$ of the total ATOM gets slashed.</li></ul>



<p>If the unstable validator nodes crash or the private key gets compromised, or the validator involuntarily commits a faulty action, their staked ATOM tokens will get slashed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://preprod.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-27.png"  alt="pic 2"  class="wp-image-32329" ></figure>



<h2 id="staking-perspectives-and-takeaways"><br>Staking Perspectives And Takeaways</h2>



<p>Staking ATOM is like the safety deposit when it comes to validation. When delegators or validators want to reclaim part of or all their deposit, they send unbonding transactions. Once they initiate this transaction, the ATOM undergoes an unbonding period of 3 weeks. During this time, they are liable to be slashed for potential misbehaviors that the validator commits before the process starts.</p>



<p>Validators and delegators receive fees and block rewards and participate in governance. If a validator misbehaves, a part of the total ATOM stake is slashed. The total revenue obtained is always divided between the validator and delegator in proportion to their respective stakes. There is a commission that is applied to the revenue belonging to the delegators before it gets distributed.</p>



<p>The staking pool of a validator can earn different types of revenue:</p>



<ul><li>Block rewards that are native application tokens validators run that get inflated to produce block rewards. They are available to bonded ATOM tokens encouraging delegators to bond their ATOM.</li><li>Transaction fees that are tokens are accepted as payment. In this case, they are ATOM.</li></ul>



<h2 id="specifics-of-validating-the-cosmos-network-nbsp"><br>Specifics of Validating the Cosmos Network&nbsp;</h2>



<p>For one to become a validator, they need to send a create-validator transaction and fill out the following areas:</p>



<ul><li>Validators Pubkey: It is a private key used to sign pre-commits and pre-votes.</li><li>Validator’s Address: It is the address used to identify the validator publicly.</li><li>Validator’s name (moniker)</li><li>Validator’s website (optional)</li><li>Validator’s description (optional)</li><li>The initial commission rate is the commission rate on fees and block rewards charged to delegators.</li><li>The maximum commission is the maximum commission rate that the validator can charge and cannot be changed after the create-validator is processed.</li><li>Commission max change rate is the maximum daily increase of the validator’s commission and cannot be changed after the create-validator is processed.</li><li>Maximum self-delegation is the minimum number of bonded ATOM the validator needs to have. The staking pool will be unbound if the stake falls below the validator’s limit.</li></ul>



<p>Once a validator is established, ATOM holders can delegate their ATOM to them, enabling them to add to their stock. Only 100 out of the validator candidates who signaled themselves are chosen to be validators. Eventually, the number of validators might increase through on-chain governance proposals.</p>

<p>No! Delegators value validators based on their criteria. Validators can register website addresses during the nomination phase to help market themselves. Some delegators choose validators based on their public profile, while others select anonymous validators with proven track records.</p>



<h3 id="can-a-validator-run-away-with-the-delegator-s-atom"><br>Can a validator run away with the delegator’s ATOM?</h3>



<p>Delegators give the validators their voting power once they are under them. The more voting power a validator has, the more weight they have when it comes to governance. However, validators do not have the ability to take custody of the ATOM owned by the delegator. Delegators are still held liable when the validator misbehaves.</p>



<h3 id="what-are-the-responsibilities-of-validators"><br>What are the responsibilities of validators?</h3>



<p>The responsibilities of validators are:</p>



<ol><li>To always run the correct software version. They need to ensure that their private keys are not compromised and the servers are always online.</li><li>To actively take part in governance by voting on proposals.</li></ol>



<h3 id="how-do-validators-participate-in-governance"><br>How do validators participate in governance?</h3>



<p>Validators and delegators participate in governance by voting on proposals. The proposals are usually on changing things like the block gas limit. They represent the delegators under them when voting even if the delegators do not vote.</p>



<h3 id="what-measures-can-be-taken-to-prevent-stake-concentration-in-the-hands-of-few-validators"><br>What measures can be taken to prevent stake concentration in the hands of few validators?</h3>



<p>The community has put measures in place to decentralize the concentration of stakes. This includes the penalty-free re-delegation where delegators can switch from one validator to another. Wallets can also give delegators warnings when they want to choose a validator who already has high stakes.</p>



<p>The community is also self-preserving when a lot of mining power is directed to one crypto.</p>



<h2 id="conclusion"><br>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Delegators need to perform due diligence when it comes to choosing validators. Just because they take part in major decisions does not mean that they can do anything they want. If a validator misbehaves, the delegators will lose a share of their revenue, as they are also held liable. Delegators can reduce the risk by using multiple validators, and they can switch if they feel like their validator is not performing well.</p>

<h3 id="q4-2019-tezos-xtz-price-forecast-technical-and-fundamental-analysis">Q4 2019 Tezos(XTZ) Price Forecast: Technical And Fundamental Analysis</h3>



<p>Tezos is a cryptocurrency project that was launched in September 2018 after an extraordinary internal scandal that followed after an extraordinarily successful ICO in which Tezos raised $232 million. The nature of that scandal was in the difference of the companies that were in control of the project and in control of the raised funds. They were different entities the former being DLS (Dynamic Control Management) and the latter being Tezos Foundation.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrency issued by the project is tickered XTZ. Tezos works on a blockchain based on the liquid proof-of-stake consensus. Tezos has on-chain governance and self-amendments which are based on distributed decision making and evolutionary soft-forking. Tezos has several two features: the first one is two kinds of wallets &#8212; implicit and originated ones; the second one is baking which is an equivalent of minting for other cryptocurrencies underpinned by proof-of-stake consensus.</p>



<p>The implicit wallets have a public address starting with tz1 and two keys: public and private ones. The important function of the implicit wallets that they can make originated wallets. Originated wallets are necessary for delegating the funds held in it to bakers. Bakers are network members who get rewarded for generating new blocks like miners are rewarded for finding the right hash values in PoW-based cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>At the time of writing Tezos is ranking in the 22nd place among cryptocurrencies by capitalisation with its capitalisation constituting $772 million as per CoinMarketCap website. At the time of writing Tezos is in a bearish market on the daily timeframe so far being considerably higher than its low for 2019 that occurred in January.</p>



<h3 id="technical-analysis">Technical analysis</h3>



<p>Tezos was in an upswing from March 9th to May 19th, 2019. The Fibonacci retracement drawn from the January low of $0.32 (Kraken quote) up to the May high shows a strong contingency of the price on the support and resistance levels formed by those levels while Tezos has been in a downtrend since its May’s high.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/O9EO0YcxJLT_rcDCU5_wBLs9wR6ppjNXpcVmlRmbzAPBdHa-s0U0B5xgOLs7a-Azx_IRpO4XJr5pMoZ2dqpKSSE1XvqbbTbbMH-l8ljk_n_KN2CUGtapnTN9BGQft82-2C1_Egx0"  alt="" ></figure>



<p>Thus, since June 4th till June 24th the price was basically fluctuating in the corridor formed by the 0.382 and 0.5 Fib levels. Later on, breaking down below 0.5 the price basically found support at 0.618 which was at $0.94. Bouncing up off that support level XTZ found resistance right at the 0.382 Fibonacci level where graphic resistance had also been formed when the price was bouncing between the 0.382 and 0.5 levels while in the sideways trend in June.</p>



<p>As for now, we can state that the downtrend is in the phase where it can be broken because each high in a downtrend must follow below the previous one as per the Dow trading theory. In this case, the latest high that was registered on July 4th is almost level with the previous June one. This situation may have several resolutions the most reasonable of which are two ones: a correction to the 0.5 Fibonacci level with a subsequent move up and a correction to the 0.618 Fibonacci level with a subsequent move up.</p>



<p>Scenario 1</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wAFlggkN-mD_rus9VjMCv1vo0CXGZSIeTe2qLxk6tKsR6-PbpHUZGOgkIXmaNHEzNoH-m5zuqDdoi8LltTcCReIpSn36OtwGPs8ZjdA9ZolPJs-pV8W43ED2cjjQCBJAatIM58ow"  alt="" ></figure>



<p>Scenario 2</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/GuvW-NQac9XjlOQ7PeuHrBXFyAY0WhQQLljBlFP4kmr9meHyhD5CaeVKBRUrmRjLc91fBgkIqG40-vP4wluHawLD061may4-mTDfkifvNdi6AD0of5wvw6Fj3gAXzvSPZBdFKbZt"  alt="" ></figure>



<p>In the first scenario, the probability of the uptrend will be also increased by the reversed head-and-shoulders candlestick pattern which will inevitably form in case the price finds support at the 0.5 Fibonacci level. In the second scenario, the odds that the price will be supported by the 0.618 Fibonacci level are very high and in that case we will have a double bottom, which is a very strong bullish reversal pattern.</p>



<h3 id="fundamental-analysis">Fundamental analysis</h3>



<p>On July 3th, a Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual and a Dubai-based investment platform Dalma published a press release in which they said that they would be using the Tezos blockchain to address a deal pipeline in excess of $1 billion for existing and prospective token issuances. On the back of that news XTZ surged against the downtrend that it was experiencing at that time.</p>



<p>The news was certainly a catalyst to the growth of the cryptocurrency and might have a continuous effect upon its price because it indicates substantial interest towards this cryptocurrency from classical financial institution which are ready to invest the sums that can alter the landscape of the entire cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>Thus, it is another serious pro-growth factor which gives Tezos more bullish bias making long to mid-term long positions unarguably preferable over short ones.</p>



<h3 id="verdict">Verdict</h3>



<p>For quarter 4 of 2019, we expect a rise in the price of Tezos due to the technical factors seen in the behaviour of the price in relation to the Fibonacci retracement drawn from the January low to the May high and the recent positive news feed on Tezos coming from classical investment institutions. Therefore, we recommend buying Tezos at the following price levels by the Kraken quote:<br></p>

<h3 id="q4-2019-nem-xem-price-forecast-technical-and-fundamental-analysis">Q4 2019 NEM (XEM) Price Forecast: Technical And Fundamental Analysis</h3>



<p>NEM is a transparent cryptocurrency running on a centralised blockchain. The cryptocurrency of NEM is XEM. The project started out on March 31, 2015. There was only one issuance of all 8,999,999,999 XEM; therefore, there is no mining NEM. Still, there is a system of incentivisation called harvesting.&nbsp; Basically, harvesting is the claiming of transaction fee for processing a transaction which is done by supernodes, and harvesters are supernode operators who take that reward. However, the fees are very small compared to Bitcoin because harvesting is based on proof of importance which consumes a hundred times less electricity than Bitcoin’s proof of work. For this reason, NEM transactions are extremely cheap.</p>



<p>However, NEM harvesting yields profit that is worth the effort because NEM’s blockchain can process 3,000 transactions per second with the block time being 1 minute. In order to become a NEM harvester, you need to have at least 10,000 vested XEM in your balance. NEM’s proof-of-importance algorithm selects the supernodes that should process transactions and harvest the block into which they are written. The importance rank of the supernodes is determined by the amount of XEM vested in it.</p>



<p>NEM was initially built as a permissioned, transparent network that should be highly scalable and have a high throughput rate. NEM transactions are almost as fast as a bank card transfer and show up in the receiver’s wallet in 6 seconds after being made by the sender and take around 20 seconds to confirm. This along with transaction transparency allows NEM to be regarded as a possible rival of traditional payment systems working with fiat money such as PayPal and Visa.</p>



<p>As of July 10, 2019, NEM occupies the 22nd position in the cryptocurrency ranking by market cap with around $807 million according to the CoinMarketCap website. At this time, the price of NEM is progressing in a sideways trend.</p>



<h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical analysis</h2>



<p>At the time of writing, XEM is being traded in a sideways channel on the daily timeframe roughly between $0.077 and $0.10 (Poloniex quote) per one XEM. Prior to that, XEM was in an uptrend that began on February 7, 2019 and ended on May 16, 2019 in a bullish candle with a high upper shadow.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1188"  height="849"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nem-xem-price-prediction-2019-1.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-1283"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nem-xem-price-prediction-2019-1.png 283w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nem-xem-price-prediction-2019-1.png 716w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nem-xem-price-prediction-2019-1.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nem-xem-price-prediction-2019-1.png 1511w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nem-xem-price-prediction-2019-1.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nem-xem-price-prediction-2019-1.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nem-xem-price-prediction-2019-1.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nem-xem-price-prediction-2019-1.png 1188w"  sizes="(max-width: 1188px) 100vw, 1188px" ></figure>



<p>As for the future pricing of this cryptocurrency, it is reasonable to assume that it has a good growth potential because, historically, XEM has been at two dollars’ mark in January 2018. Hence, presently, it costs less than 0.5% of its historical maximum price.</p>



<p>As for Q4 of 2019, the pricing of NEM greatly depends on the direction in which the sideways channel will be broken. Right now, we have numerous fluctuations from both its upper and lower borders. We also should not neglect the 20-period and 50-period Moving Averages because they can give us some notion of the direction in which the price might break through this sideways channel, too.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1188"  height="849"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nem-xem-technical-analyzis-1.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-1284"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nem-xem-technical-analyzis-1.png 283w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nem-xem-technical-analyzis-1.png 716w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nem-xem-technical-analyzis-1.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nem-xem-technical-analyzis-1.png 1511w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nem-xem-technical-analyzis-1.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nem-xem-technical-analyzis-1.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nem-xem-technical-analyzis-1.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nem-xem-technical-analyzis-1.png 1188w"  sizes="(max-width: 1188px) 100vw, 1188px" ></figure>



<p>If we view it from the Elliott wave perspective we can distinctly see a five way pattern at the stage of the forming of its fourth wave. </p>



<p>The pattern of corrective waves in this case looks very logical and goes in line with the Elliott wave theory. It is very typical of corrective waves to alternate in their graphic patterns within one motive cycle. Very rarely we can observe two corrective waves of a similar model within one 5-wave cycle. Therefore, after the completion of the fourth corrective wave in this pattern we can reasonably await the fifth wave that should end this 5-wave cycle. However, we should be cautious about relying heavily on the Elliot wave principle as it works best for stocks and commodities and is not much recommended for analysing currency markets.</p>



<h3 id="fundamental-analysis">Fundamental analysis</h3>



<p>From the fundamental perspective, we should look on May 16 when NEM added 27% while Bitcoin lost 2.6%. On that day, there came through the news about Zeux a payment app adding NEM to its list of currencies which should allow all NEM owners pay with NEM at all stores through Apple Pay and Samsung Pay using Apple and Samsung smart mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another piece of news that came that day was the announcement by NEM about a coming launch of a new website of NEM Blockchain Center.</p>



<p>Those two announcements must have propelled NEM up high with a consolidation setting in immediately after that sharp surge.</p>



<h3 id="verdict">Verdict</h3>



<p>As of now, a breakout above the daily resistance at $0.10 looks a more likely scenarios for NEM as outcome from the currently ongoing consolidation. Therefore, it will be rational to buy NEM at the lower region of this consolidation channel and above its upper border in the event of the price breaking through the resistance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Q4 2019, the suggested entry levels for long positions on NEM (XEM) are:</p>



<ul><li>$0.077</li><li>$0.081</li><li>$0.102</li></ul>



<p>with TP levels being:</p>



<ul><li>$0.125</li><li>$0.185.</li></ul>

<h3 id="cardano-ada-price-forecast-technical-and-fundamental-analysis">Cardano (ADA) Price Forecast: Technical And Fundamental Analysis</h3>



<p>Cardano (ADA) is a comparatively young cryptocurrency project that was founded by Charles Hoskinson in 2014. Cardano runs on a proof-of-stake consensus decentralized network and provides a classical set of features for cryptocurrencies plus some exclusive fancy-sounding features: decentralized applications (dapps), a multi-asset ledger, verifiable smart contracts.</p>



<p>On&nbsp; June 5th, 2019 on the project’s team’s Twitter account posted the news about an update for the Cardano 2020 vision that was contained in an improved version of Cardano roadmap. The primary noteworthy things in this roadmap are five development eras: Byron, Shelly, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire. The updated roadmap demonstrates future prospects for Cardano and the proactive performance of the IOHK team on the project.</p>



<p>The work on Cardano started in 2014 triggered by Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson who is one of the first Ethereum developers. In September 2017, an ICO for Cardano was launched during which the project’s capitalization reached half a billion dollars. It was on&nbsp; December 1st, 2017 the roadmap for Cardano was published mapping out the development of the project. At that time the publication was a serious price moving factor.</p>



<h3 id="technical-analysis">Technical analysis</h3>



<p>Cardano has been growing steadily since mid-December 2018 until now (July 4, 2019). Since mid-May 2019 up till early July, the ADA price has been fluctuating in a sideways channel in the range $0.073 – $0.106 (the latest high) according to the Kraken quote, the 0,382 Fibonacci level at $0.075 acting very successfully as a support for the price.</p>



<p>At present, the price is below the 50-period Moving Average on the daily timeframe nearing the 0.382 Fibonacci level. The next support level is the 0.50 Fibonacci level at $0.066. As currently, the token’s price sits at around $0.08, which is below its price during the ICO when it cost $0.10, and has been at and past the $1 handle in its history, this is a good market situation for buying ADA for a mid to long-term investment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1188"  height="849"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cardano-price-prediction-2019.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-1290"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cardano-price-prediction-2019.png 283w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cardano-price-prediction-2019.png 716w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cardano-price-prediction-2019.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cardano-price-prediction-2019.png 1511w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cardano-price-prediction-2019.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cardano-price-prediction-2019.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cardano-price-prediction-2019.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cardano-price-prediction-2019.png 1188w"  sizes="(max-width: 1188px) 100vw, 1188px" ></figure>



<p>However, in early July a downward crossover of the 50-period Moving Average by the 20-period Moving Average is forming on the daily timeframe. In case it actually takes place it will be a marker of a bearish reversal; therefore, it will be a safer option to buy ADA at a subsequent marker of a bullish move which can be a bounce up off the 0.382 Fibonacci level or price consolidation near it in the narrow support zone above it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1188"  height="849"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cardano-technical-analyzis-2019.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-1291"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cardano-technical-analyzis-2019.png 283w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cardano-technical-analyzis-2019.png 716w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cardano-technical-analyzis-2019.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cardano-technical-analyzis-2019.png 1511w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cardano-technical-analyzis-2019.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cardano-technical-analyzis-2019.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cardano-technical-analyzis-2019.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cardano-technical-analyzis-2019.png 1188w"  sizes="(max-width: 1188px) 100vw, 1188px" ></figure>



<p>Aiming at a mid to long-term investment a preliminary TP level would be $0.156, which is a 1.618 Fibonacci level (Kraken quote).</p>



<h3 id="fundamental-analysis">Fundamental analysis</h3>



<p>The earlier spoken about updated roadmap provides a plan for the development of the Cardano project till the end of 2020. The five eras that it consists of contain technical implementations, research, and prototyping. Some of the eras overlap. Thus, Byron, Shelley, and Goguen started in 2017 and they are scheduled to end in 2019 as per roadmap; some earlier and some later.</p>



<p>The Byron era is the foundation of the project, Shelley is decentralization, Goguen is about smart contracts, Basho is scaling and Voltaire is governance. Currently, in the end of 2019, the project is actively working on finalizing the Shelley era and implementing the programming features planned for Goguen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the Goguen era, the project’s development team plans to make a guarantee-based Cardano smart contracts accessible to a broader audience of users. Another goal for this era is the creation and improvement of Plutus – a language for code development which will be functional on-chain as well as off-chain and will simplify the execution of smart contracts. For the final stages of Goguen is planned the implementation of Marlowe – a domain-specific language based on Plutus with the purpose of simplifying the writing of smart contracts.</p>



<h3 id="verdict">Verdict</h3>



<p>From the fundamental point of view, the Cardano team is doing a very consistent job that goes in line with the roadmap the updated version of which should provide new insights into the future of the projects and its token ADA. A major technical advantage of this project lies with scalability as it was initially designed as the first coin of blockchain 3.0 as promoted by its team. This may help Cardano to see broader adoption in the near future and, as a result, growth in its capitalization.</p>



<p>Technically speaking, the price of the asset is very low compared with its peak price in January 2018. Therefore, it will be logical to assume that the ADA coin has a good growth potential just out of the mere principle of market cycles: after a fall a rise must follow.</p>



<p>In case the team performs well and delivers upon its plan outlined in the roadmap it will not be ignored by the market and its core players.</p>



<p>In our view, Cardano (ADA) is a good asset to the cryptocurrency market to invest into in 2019 and it may see a rise in the fourth quarter of 2019. The suggested buy levels are $0.076, $0.066.</p>



<p>with the TP level being at $0.156.<br></p>

<h3 id="q4-2019-ethereum-classic-etc-price-forecast-technical-and-fundamental-analysis">Q4 2019 Ethereum Classic (ETC) Price Forecast: Technical And Fundamental Analysis</h3>



<p>Ethereum Classic (ETC) is the version of the original Ethereum blockchain including the DAO attack which took place in 2016 at which point the Ethereum blockchain was divided through a hard fork leaving the original blockchain under the name of Ethereum Classic and a split-out, which did not include the DAO attack, under the name of Ethereum. As of the beginning of July 2019, this cryptocurrency occupies the 20th position by market capitalization which stands at around 855 million USD. So, how does the Ethereum Classic Price Prediction look like?</p>



<p>With the reversal of the trend on the cryptocurrency market in the second quarter of 2019, all major cryptocurrencies including Ethereum Classic are showing bullish dynamics in Q2 and Q3 of 2019 compared to Q3 and Q4 of 2018 and Q1 of 2019.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="technical-analysis-on-ethereum-classic-price-prediction">Technical Analysis on Ethereum Classic Price Prediction</h3>



<p>In April 2019, ETC showed a sharp momentary rise to $8.08 by the Bitfinex quote, which collapsed after that for around 75% of its value in 17 days. In May 2019, there was found a support at $5.42, which coincided with at least two peaks at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 during the sideways trend at that time. The May support also coincided with the 50-period Moving Average on the daily timeframe bouncing off it twice with a false breakdown in the second time.</p>



<p>In June 2019, the April high was toppled by another high at $9.85 (Bitfinex quote).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1188"  height="849"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ethereum-classic-price-prediction-1.png"  alt="Technical Analysis on Ethereum Classic Price Prediction"  class="wp-image-1295"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ethereum-classic-price-prediction-1.png 283w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ethereum-classic-price-prediction-1.png 716w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ethereum-classic-price-prediction-1.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ethereum-classic-price-prediction-1.png 1511w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ethereum-classic-price-prediction-1.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ethereum-classic-price-prediction-1.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ethereum-classic-price-prediction-1.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ethereum-classic-price-prediction-1.png 1188w"  sizes="(max-width: 1188px) 100vw, 1188px" ><figcaption>Technical Analysis</figcaption></figure>



<p>After the attainment of that level the price fell again to $6.67. Thus, the bullish trend continued with the supports forming above the previous ones. The latest high was at $9.85. After that there was a correction that continued the bullish trend using the 20-period Moving Average as a support on the daily timeframe.</p>



<p>However, that tendency was broken on June 27th, where the price fell below the 50-period Moving Average. And we can observe the forming of a downward crossover of the 20-period Moving Average through the 50-period Moving Average on the daily timeframe which is a certain marker of a bearish reversal.</p>



<h2 id="more">More</h2>



<p>Looking forward into Q4 2019. We can now assume that ETC has shown strong upward dynamics from its lows in the late 2018. That gives grounds for further growth throughout 2019 just according to the simple rule of trend momentum. Analyzing the future ETC price, we should still bear in mind the influence of Bitcoin on the entire market. Bitcoin, as of the beginning of July 2019, shows a typical Elliott formation. Currently standing at the beginning of the second corrective wave on the daily timeframe.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1188"  height="849"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ethereum-classicprice-prediction-2019.png"  alt="Technical Analysis on Ethereum Classic Price Prediction"  class="wp-image-1296"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ethereum-classicprice-prediction-2019.png 283w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ethereum-classicprice-prediction-2019.png 716w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ethereum-classicprice-prediction-2019.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ethereum-classicprice-prediction-2019.png 1511w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ethereum-classicprice-prediction-2019.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ethereum-classicprice-prediction-2019.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ethereum-classicprice-prediction-2019.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ethereum-classicprice-prediction-2019.png 1188w"  sizes="(max-width: 1188px) 100vw, 1188px" ><figcaption>Technical Analysis</figcaption></figure>



<p>Therefore, we can rightfully expect the third motive wave, the most prominent motive wave, in August 2019 trough to Q4 2019. It will produce a substantial bullish impact on the entire cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>Important levels for ETC according to the Bitfinex quote currently are $5.81 (0.618), $6.58 (0.50) $8.31 (0.236), $5.63 (a daily support level).</p>



<p><a href="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/price-prediction/ripple-price-prediction"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Read more on Ripple Price prediction</span></a></p>



<h3 id="fundamental-analysis">Fundamental analysis</h3>



<p>On July 1st, 2019 Ethereum Classic Labs announced a partnership with Metronome. It will provide ‘chainhop’ blockchain interoperability between the blockchains of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. This will allow to move Metronome tokens between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic blockchains. </p>



<p>This partnership is a part of a bigger upgrade called ECIP &#8212; 1054 (Atlantis). This upgrade aims at improving interoperability between the blockchains of ETH and ETC. Thereby, pulling the ETC blockchain up to the latest version of ETH protocol. This upgrade will enhance stability and security of ETC.</p>



<h4 id="more-2">More</h4>



<p>The implementation of Atlantis has been discussed with all the stakeholders in Ethereum Classic. So far, they have all agreed on this upgrade. The implementation is scheduled for the block 8,772,000, which will occur on September 17th, which will be a Tuesday.</p>



<p>The implementation of Atlantis will be done by ETC Labs in cooperation with Metronome. Where the two companies will issue a cryptocurrency MET that will be transferable between the ETH and ETC blockchains.</p>



<p>This update is believed to be a very important milestone in the development of the Ethereum Classic. It will soon grant this cryptocurrency a bigger share in the cryptocurrency market. Therefore, it is awaited with anticipation by many cryptocurrency experts and cryptocurrency market analysts.</p>



<h3 id="verdict">Verdict</h3>



<p>ETC is currently (the beginning of July 2019) experiencing the influence of resistance at $9.85 with the buy sentiment being still predominant for the asset. However, it is advisable for position and long-term traders to buy ETC at the following levels: $5.56, $5.80, $6.66.</p>



<p>with the target TP levels for Q4 2019 being at $14.40 and $17.43 on the Bitfinex chart.<br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3 id="coin"><span id="what-is-eos">What is EOS?</span></h3>



<p>EOS is a cryptocurrency and a blockchain at the same time. EOS decentralized platform is widely used by developers to build their own dapps, and in order to access the EOS blockchain, it is necessary to have EOS coins. To date, the company has shown enormous potential of both products which attract investments as never before. One of the reasons behind the world’s growing interest in EOS is the platform’s ability to process 50,000 transactions per second.</p>



<p>Like the whole crypto market, last year&nbsp;<a href="https://atomicwallet.io/eos-wallet">EOS&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;first faced rise and then a sharp decline in its value which represented a 71 % decrease in comparison to the coin’s cost in January. Thus, the&nbsp;EOS coin price jumped from almost $9 in January to $21 in April&nbsp;which constituted the coin’s highest value of 2018 and then fell to almost $2 over the course of the year.&nbsp;Despite all these fluctuations EOS ranks third in the classification of 100 largest cryptocurrencies&nbsp;in terms of market capitalization. According to the latest EOS news, the EOS current price is $3.69 USD.</p>



<p>In this article, we accumulate various EOS price predictions made by famous crypto experts for the following two years and give a full explanation of where and how it is possible to buy and exchange EOS. In particular, you can use&nbsp;<a href="https://atomicwallet.io/">Atomic Wallet</a>&nbsp;which supports over 300 different tokens and offers best currency exchange rates for many popular currency pairs.</p>



<h3 id="the-history-of-eos">The history of EOS</h3>



<p>The coin was created in 2017 by&nbsp;Daniel Larimer&nbsp;who had previously developed Bitshares and Steem. In contrast to the majority of cryptocurrencies, its ICO and token distribution lasted a year. EOS differs from other blockchain-based platforms in many ways: firstly, it processes over 50,000 operations per second; secondly, EOS cannot be mined but purchased and its maximum supply is one billion coins.<br><br>The biggest competitor &#8211; Bitcoin &#8211; has a much lower processing speed and cannot support the proper development of decentralized applications shooting up like mushrooms. Besides, EOS overcomes Ethereum in terms of processing speed and offers customers tools to build more top-notch applications. On these grounds, EOS is likely to have a bright future and stay one of the leaders among other coins.</p>



<p>As you can see in the chart below, the currency suffered some fluctuations during the last year and has been quite steady lately, the EOS current price is $3.69 USD.</p>



<h3 id="market"><span id="market-prediction-for-eos-price">Market prediction for EOS price</span></h3>



<p>What are EOS price predictions for 2019? The future development of the coin is determined by various factors including upcoming upgrades of the platform as well as highly unpredictable market sentiment towards the coin which largely determines the EOS current price. Anyway, one cannot deny that EOS is a promising project that is able to measure up to the world’s blockchain leaders such as&nbsp;<a href="https://atomicwallet.io/ethereum-wallet">Ethereum</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://atomicwallet.io/neo-wallet">NEO</a>&nbsp;etc. According to the company founder Daniel Larimer, EOS presents brand new scalability and governance which make many dapps move to the platform. Some experts are optimistic about the coin’s price in 2019 while others maintain a position that the year will be rather bearish.</p>



<h3 id="1-eos-price-prediction">#1 EOS Price Prediction</h3>



<p>One of the Steemit.com writers makes a positive EOS price prediction for 2019, indicating that the&nbsp;EOS coin price might reach $70&nbsp;over the course of the year in case the situation is favorable.&nbsp;Otherwise, EOS will not pass the $20 mark. Whether&nbsp;the cost of the coin&nbsp;will moon&nbsp;is determined by two main factors&nbsp;which are&nbsp;possible changes in the regulation of the crypto market, a potential&nbsp;massive capital inflow from China and the United States&nbsp;as well as upcoming upgrades of the platform which might attract a bigger audience and boost the price naturally. The author indicates that we just have to follow the EOS news, as any of these factors can provoke a fast growth of the coin’s value.</p>



<h3 id="2-walletinvestor-eos-price-prediction">#2 WalletInvestor EOS Price Prediction</h3>



<p>Another bullish EOS price prediction for 2019 is made by Wallet Investor. The experts see the coin as a favorable venture, forecasting a&nbsp;stable increase in the EOS value in the short term and expecting it to reach $911 USD in 2024.</p>

<h3 id="3-tradingbeasts-com-eos-price-prediction">#3 TradingBeasts.com EOS Price Prediction</h3>



<p>Tradingbeasts.com predicts a rather bearish year for the coin. Thus, the&nbsp;coin is expected to reach its maximum of $9.12 USD&nbsp;only by the end of the year, while&nbsp;the lowest EOS coin price might be $5.56 USD. The experts forecast a gradual increase in the coin’s value throughout the year which is not expected to drop again until the EOS current price.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img  loading="lazy"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eos-tradingbeasts-price-prediction.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-14313"  width="203"  height="401"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eos-tradingbeasts-price-prediction.png 297w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eos-tradingbeasts-price-prediction-152x300.png 152w"  sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px" ></figure>



<h3 id="4-coinswitch-io-eos-price-prediction">#4 CoinSwitch.io EOS Price Prediction</h3>



<p>A more optimistic forecast for 2019 EOS value is made by Coinswitch.co, emphasizing a great potential of the platform technology for the future of decentralized applications. According to the EOS news, 2019 will see major improvements of the platform which can increase the acceptance ratio. Taking it into consideration,&nbsp;the price of the coin is expected to reach $15 USD&nbsp;which is almost&nbsp;4 times bigger than its current price.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="882"  height="171"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eos-coinswitch-price-prediction.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-14325"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eos-coinswitch-price-prediction.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eos-coinswitch-price-prediction.png 1024w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eos-coinswitch-price-prediction.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eos-coinswitch-price-prediction.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eos-coinswitch-price-prediction.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eos-coinswitch-price-prediction.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eos-coinswitch-price-prediction.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eos-coinswitch-price-prediction.png 882w"  sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" ></figure>



<h3 id="5-cryptoground-com-eos-price-prediction">#5 CryptoGround.com EOS Price Prediction</h3>



<p>Cryptoground.com makes a rather positive price estimate based on the neural network algorithm. Thus, the&nbsp;EOS value is expected to reach $4.5433 USD in 6 months&nbsp;and&nbsp;$7.5911 USD in one year.&nbsp;Based on the algorithm output, the platform considers investing in EOS profitable, especially, for the long term, as the EOS price prediction seems bullish for the following years.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="708"  height="429"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eos-cryptoground-price-prediction.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-14337"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eos-cryptoground-price-prediction.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eos-cryptoground-price-prediction.png 845w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eos-cryptoground-price-prediction.png 708w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eos-cryptoground-price-prediction.png 1782w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eos-cryptoground-price-prediction.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eos-cryptoground-price-prediction.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eos-cryptoground-price-prediction.png 380w"  sizes="(max-width: 708px) 100vw, 708px" ></figure>



<h3 id="2019"><span id="eos-price-prediction-2019">EOS price prediction 2019</span></h3>



<p>Even though experts disagree about a possible EOS price estimate for the following months, the acceptance ratio of the coin is gradually increasing together with the EOS current price, as the platform presents great prospects for the development of decentralized applications and overcome&nbsp;<a href="https://atomicwallet.io/ethereum-wallet">Ethereum</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://atomicwallet.io/bitcoin-wallet">Bitcoin</a>&nbsp;in terms of technology. Right now EOS ranks fifth in the list of top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap and its trade volume continues to increase, as you can see in the EOS news. Looking ahead,&nbsp;EOS is expected to drop its value in March and significantly recover in May, maintaining a stable growth pace till the end of the year when it&nbsp;might reach the $15 mark. If the crypto regulation becomes more favorable, the&nbsp;coin’s price is expected to hit $70 USD in December 2019.</p>



<h3 id="2020"><span id="eos-price-prediction-2020">EOS price prediction 2020</span></h3>



<p>2020 EOS price estimate is more positive than the one for 2019. Thus,&nbsp;Coinswitch.co predicts an increase in its value during the first half of the year and in July 2020 EOS might hit the mark of $95. However, there is a slight chance that the price will decline for the rest of the year reaching $56 in December 2020. The forecast made by&nbsp;Tradingbeasts.com&nbsp;is less bullish, as the platform experts&nbsp;expect the price fluctuate from $10 to $16 throughout the year. Another prediction is given by&nbsp;Theoofy.com&nbsp;and&nbsp;includes two scenarios for 2020 EOS price behavior. Suggesting a climate is favorable, the&nbsp;coin might reach $22 throughout the year 2020, while in a less optimistic scenario EOS will stick to the $7 to 9$ mark. One way or another, EOS is seen as a significant competitor for Ethereum and is expected to upgrade its technology by far in the next two years.</p>



<h3 id="verdict"><span id="eos-price-prediction-verdict">EOS Price Prediction Verdict</span></h3>



<p>In 2018 EOS proved to be a perfect platform for the development of decentralized applications due to its advanced technologies which have already started to question Bitcoin’s and Ethereum’s leadership, as it says on the EOS news. With the growing popularity of the platform, the coin’s value inevitably surges. It seems that EOS is destined to attract much more investors and grow in the next years. s<br><br>The EOS price predictions for 2019 may differ but almost all of them imply an increase in the coin’s value for the upcoming months. Ranking fifth in terms of market capitalization, EOS takes the notions of scalability and governance to a whole new level, thus presenting a perfect option of investors, especially, for the long-term. If you are inclined to invest in EOS, you can benefit from a first non-custodial Atomic Wallet offering a chance to buy and manage more than three hundred coins in a single and easy-to-use interface.</p>

<h3 id="neo-cryptocurrency-disadvantages">NEO Cryptocurrency Disadvantages</h3>



<p>Despite the fact that many are buying up the currency, there are several versions regarding its inherent flaws. It should be noted that the NEO currency unit is strictly centralized, and about half of all coins are concentrated in the hands of developers. It is believed that the project is supported by not very reliable technical training and the presence of the risk of incurring double spending. Also, the lack of mining is considered a disadvantage by many.</p>



<p>These factors should not be regarded as negative aspects since many shortcomings are almost completely eliminated, and the absence of mining is the wrong decision, as it is, it is simply carried out according to a slightly different scheme.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-tron-trx">What is TRON (TRX)?</h3>



<p>TRX is a decentralized blockchain initially based on Ethereum codebase adopted mostly for the entertainment market. Using the Tron platform, the audience can thus create their own individual gaming and entertainment projects, publish software, text, and graphics (visual) content, store it or transfer it for rent, for a fee, distribute and promote it through issuing and receiving assets.</p>



<h3 id="tron-price-prediction-2019">Tron Price Prediction 2019</h3>



<p>As of February 18, 2019, the TRX rate is $0.024, the market capitalization is $ 1.65 billion. With these indicators, the project holds 8th place in the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/">Coinmarketcap rating</a>.<br><br>No matter how long the current market falls, the revival and new stages of development of the Tron platform are ahead. At the beginning of the year, the most pessimistic forecast for TRON for 2019 was $ 0.04. However, the reason for this is not the problems of the project, but only the general situation in the crypto industry. The main part of sober-thinking and unbiased experts agree that in the 2019th TRX will cost between $ 0.5—1.<br><br>Thus, in a short time, the Tron team turned out to be able to prove the main thing: their brainchild is not just another bubble, but a promising long-playing project that will fully demonstrate its strengths in the next 10 years.</p>



<h3 id="tron-trx-market-analysis">Tron (TRX) Market Analysis</h3>



<p>#1 Investingpr.com Tron Price Prediction<br>Tron price will reach $1 in less than 5 years, seems to be real.</p>



<p>#2 WalletInvestor Tron Price Prediction<br>In 1 year TRX will cost less than $ 0.0035.</p>



<p>#3 CoinTame Tron Price Prediction<br>In 2019 TRX might reach $0.633 and by the end of 2020 may reach $1.</p>



<p>#4 CryptoGround.com Tron Price Prediction<br>TRX will be 0.04 by the end of 2019.</p>



<h3 id="tron-price-prediction-2020">Tron Price Prediction 2020</h3>



<p>In 2020 TRON price is most likely will be between $0.2 and $1. TRX price also depends on the market situation on the crypto scene. The more use cases and demand will be for TRON, the more it will cost in the future. We predict that TRON price will be $0.5 by 2020.</p>



<h3 id="tron-tokens">TRON Tokens</h3>



<p>Currently, there are three types of these tokens. And they are used for various purposes:</p>



<ul><li>TRONIX (TRX).The main currency of the system. Can be exchanged for other cryptos or Fiat if there is a corresponding option. If necessary, TRX is bought on exchanges or cryptocurrency exchangers.</li><li>TRON Power (TP).&nbsp;It is impossible to buy or exchange these tokens. The only way to get them is to fasten the TRX coins on the platform. Then they are converted to TP. The resulting coins give a number of privileges in the system. For example, their owner has the right to vote for various changes on the platform.</li><li>TRC 20.&nbsp;With these tokens, third-party developers can create their own tokens based on the TRON network. The mechanism is similar to the principles of creating coins of the ERC20 standard on the Ethereum blockchain.</li></ul>



<h3 id="tron-partnerships">Tron Partnerships</h3>



<p>According to experts, recently, the leading players in the entertainment market have seriously become interested in decentralized databases and are thinking about transferring their business to the blockchain. For this, they need ready-made solutions, and TRON seems to be the best option for that purpose. The founders of Tron were able to enlist the support of prominent Asian business circles. They invested their funds in the development of the platform: Tang Binsen, the creator of the famous computer game Clash of Kings, the founder of the OFO cycle-breeding company Dai Wei, the head of Lifan industrial concern Yin Minshan and other famous personalities.</p>



<p>Tron collaborates with major IT and blockchain companies such as Bitmain, ICO-365, Bixin, Gravityless, Openledger, which adds weight to the project within the crypto community. Just the other day, Justin Sun confirmed a partnership with the largest Chinese Internet provider Baidu Browser.</p>



<h3 id="among-them">Among them:</h3>



<ul><li>The ability to create on the basis of the platform own entertainment and game projects, publish graphic, program and text content, store it, distribute and sell for crypto;</li><li>The ability to exchange and make transactions with such assets as PTS, ETH, EOS, Qtum (in the future, the list of currencies is planned to be expanded);</li><li>High level of security.</li><li>The high speed of payment transactions;</li><li>Lack of a unified data transmission and storage centre (decentralization);</li></ul>



<h3 id="how-to-buy-tron">How to buy Tron?</h3>
