<p>On August 28th, we had an AMA session with <a href="https://sharering.network/">ShareRing</a>, in our <a href="https://t.me/atomicwallet">Telegram Chat</a>.</p>



<p>ShareRing makes sharing and renting services quicker and simpler for everyone by creating an accessible and sustainable global eco-system for the sharing and renting economies.</p>



<p>The team members present on our community&#8217;s discussion were Tim Bos (ShareRing’s CEO) and Timothy Kingery (SHR Communications Mgr.).</p>



<p>Here are the essential points of the AMA session:</p>



<p>Please welcome Tim (T), Timothy (TM) and the questions from our Telegram chat members (Q).</p>



<h2 id="about-the-platform"><br>About the Platform</h2>



<p><br>Q: DeFi has been a very popular movement in crypto, does ShareRing have any plans to integrate this into its ecosystem?</p>



<p>T: Yes, we&#8217;re already working on a few things. We have been testing a DeFi model with liquidity pools for quite some time, and we&#8217;re in the process of developing the smart contracts behind it. SHR will be an integral part of it, as well as some other surprises. The DeFi product will be used by ShareRing, as well as other suppliers and partners that use our platform. It&#8217;ll be one of the first DeFi projects that have a real-world and highly scalable use case.</p>



<p><br>Q: In regards to potential adoption of your blockchain what would you say ShareRing’s main use cases are?</p>



<p>T: ShareRing was started for the purpose of developing a platform and ecosystem to support the circular economies, including sharing economy, travel industry and e-commerce. We have introduced our foundation products on our ShareLedger blockchain, which include our identity management system (ShareRing ID), our payment system (ShareRing Pay) and a number of other protocols and products to support it. Our first go-to-market products are ShareRing Travel, ShareRing Shop, Open World COVID Passport, and ShareRing ID as a standalone SDK for many other industries.</p>



<p><br>Q: What is so special about your plans about travel?</p>



<p>T: Instead of just saying that we&#8217;re a blockchain project that does travel and then doing a little more than letting people use crypto to pay for travel, we&#8217;re taking a completely different approach. When we started ShareRing, we started from the perspective of the users and looked at what was broken in the fragmented travel industry.</p>



<p>For example: Hotel check-ins are slow, booking flights can be slow and frustrating, trust between customers and experience providers can be a headache, we all hate lining up for 30 minutes at the car rental place to get our car.</p>



<p>These are the problems we are solving with ShareRing. We&#8217;re not just providing this as an app for people to book travel. We&#8217;re offering it as a platform for other online travel agents, airlines, hotels, experience providers, etc to integrate with and white-label for their own usage.</p>



<p><br>Q: ShareRing’s value proposition is how it can improve user travel experience through services such as KYC checks, eVisa application, flights and hotel bookings. How does it establish trust between customers and the industry that offers these services in the sharing economy?</p>



<p>TM: We establish and maintain trust with our ShareRing ID module. This allows users of our platform and services to carry out their KYC without the fear of personal data misuse or theft by encrypting their ID documents and proving their accuracy without sending them to third party servers where they may be vulnerable.</p>



<p><br>Q: Verifying product authenticity could be a herculean task, so how do you ensure that only legitimate products come into ShareRing’s multi-merchant shop? Do you have quality control measures or curators?</p>



<p>T: For the ShareRing shop, we are running the platform, and our partners in each region run the operations, commercial aspects, customers, etc. These partners have curators that will manage the merchant onboarding and product quality. If we did the operations ourselves, there&#8217;s no way we would scale quickly. This approach will give us more customers and more transactions on the blockchain.</p>



<p><br>Q: How did your team deal with the technical challenges of the initial launch of this product? What are some milestones to look forward to that may be the challenges in the future and how do you plan to answer them?</p>



<p>T: We have had our fair share of challenges. What we are doing isn&#8217;t simple, we&#8217;re breaking new ground with a lot of the technology we&#8217;ve developed, so it&#8217;s been constant R&amp;D, trial and error, and some pivots in how we approach a few problems. I&#8217;m extremely proud of our team and what we&#8217;ve achieved. We&#8217;ve had a few times where we felt we were ready to launch, but we felt that we were still a bit short of where we wanted to be in terms of user experience. I&#8217;m happy that we&#8217;re finally at the stage where we can launch a product that I&#8217;m happy with.</p>



<h2 id="technology"><br>Technology</h2>



<p><br>Q: ShareRing utilises a dual-token mechanism, what made you decide to go with this approach?</p>



<p>T: Our main utility token is ShareToken (SHR), this is used for transaction fees, etc on the platform. We also have another token, which is SHRP (SharePay), that is used as our stable-coin/payment token within the network. It&#8217;s not tradeable at all, except within the ecosystem. We will have other tokens, with other functions/benefits, that we introduce on ShareLegder too.</p>



<p><br>Q: ShareRing aims to promote the adoption of blockchain on a global scale so which technology and mechanism are used by ShareRing to achieve your objective.</p>



<p>T: Our blockchain is based on the Tendermint Framework and Cosmos SDK. We chose this as it offers one of the best levels of scalability and flexibility of anything we&#8217;ve come across. We also use some traditional development environments for easy integration with our partners.</p>



<h2 id="future-plans"><br>Future Plans</h2>



<p><br><br>Q: Is there an ETA on when you want to launch more tokens?</p>



<p>T: No, not yet, it&#8217;ll be for some specific projects/partners that we are working with. In all cases, SHR will still be the transaction and governance token on ShareLedger.</p>



<p><br>Q: Any plans to integrate with airline and hotel chain reward programs such as Emirates Skywards or Royal Orchid Plus? Plans of creating a debit card to use while travelling? Earning points through the app will be great.</p>



<p>T: Plans of creating a debit card to use &#8211; no, not at this stage. We&#8217;ve considered it, but our approach is to use the app to facilitate payments in the short and medium term. Plans to integrate with reward programs &#8211; yes. Interoperability with other reward programs is something we&#8217;ll introduce with ShareRing rewards.</p>



<p><br>Q: Southeast Asia is a very vibrant market and most projects are competing with campaigns here to entice users and grow. Do you plan to develop and expand in Southeast Asia?</p>



<p>T: A lot of our expansion will be via our partners. We can&#8217;t expect to compete with Expedia and Booking.com, etc, so we have a great plan that basically leverages either our partners’ existing (huge) networks, or by offering &#8216;must have&#8217; services to travellers such as eVisa On Arrival, COVID-19 pass, etc and use those as a way to upsell the other travel products.</p>



<p><br>Q: What is the plan to ensure sufficient liquidity on exchanges to fill market orders, especially as adoption increases and clients begin multiplying year-over-year?</p>



<p>T: There&#8217;s a few angles to this. Firstly, we need to make sure we leverage the user-base of those new exchanges to ensure we have additional people trading. Secondly, we also target the exchanges that are operating within the geographies that we want to expand into. Plus the usual market making, etc that&#8217;s done to help stimulate the exchange.</p>



<p><br>Q: Which market are you targeting for 2020? What strategies do you have to attract users and keep them with your platform for the long-term?</p>



<p>TM: We&#8217;re initially targeting Southeast Asia, starting with Thailand and followed by Vietnam soon after. We&#8217;re also piloting our shop in Australia with plans to expand to the rest of the country. More will follow after this. Many users will be on-boarded into our ecosystem via our partners and other services. Once they register for the ShareRing ID to use any service, they&#8217;ll have full access to the rest of our products. So our B2B partners and customers will help enormously with this.</p>



<p><br>We were glad to host <a href="https://sharering.network/">ShareRing</a> on our <a href="https://t.me/atomicwallet">Telegram</a>. Thanks to the team and all the members of the session!</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-17-copy-1920x1080-1-1920x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-31753" ></figure>



<p>On August 8th, we had an AMA session with <a href="https://qtum.org/">Qtum</a>, an open-sourced public blockchain platform in our <a href="https://t.me/atomicwallet">Telegram Chat</a>.</p>



<p>Qtum is an open-sourced public blockchain platform, leveraging the security of UTXO while enabling multiple virtual machines, including EVM and the revolutionary x86 VM.</p>



<p>The team members present in our community&#8217;s discussion were John Scianna (Qtum’s Head of Growth) and&nbsp; Jackson Belove (Sr. Research at Qtum).</p>



<p>Here are the essential points of the AMA session:</p>



<p>Please welcome John (JN), Jackson (JK), and the questions from our Telegram chat members (Q).</p>



<h2 id="about-the-platform"><br>About the Platform</h2>



<p><br>Q: Qtum is the first ever smart contract platform that utilizes Bitcoin’s UTXO model all wrapped up in a proof of stake consensus. Where did this idea come from and how long did it take to go from idea to mainnet?</p>



<p>JN: Our Co-Founder and CEO, Patrick Dai, was an early bitcoin miner. He’s from Sichuan province, where the majority of bitcoin is still mined today. But he saw that the industry was changing, with incredible foresight. Mining was becoming more competitive and proof-of-stake actually offered more security than PoW for other networks. This is still true to this day with blockchain reorgs happening on top 50 networks like Ethereum Classic. Patrick believed that the UTXO model was the most thoroughly tested blockchain, and it still is today. So, it would be easier to build from there. Every great structure has to start with a well-built foundation and that’s what the UTXO model is for us.</p>



<p><br>Q: Can you briefly discuss the major goals that Qtum is currently focusing on?</p>



<p>JN: In the pursuit to have cutting edge technology, Qtum is focusing on 3 major areas that need improvement:&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. The Offline Staking Protocol&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Qtum Phantom Confidential Assets&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. Qtum Neutron and x86 based virtual machine</p>



<p>1.The offline staking protocol will allow users to delegate their Qtum to a super staker allowing them to earn block rewards from various wallets without the requirement of running a full node.</p>



<p>2. Qtum Phantom Confidential Assets will be a platform where anyone will be able to create transparent or private (untraceable) tokens on the Qtum blockchain.</p>



<p>3. Qtum Neutron will be a new revolutionary virtual machine that opens the doors to many programmers out there.</p>



<p><br>Q: How does Qtum maintain its accuracy and ensure the entire system operates as required? Is there a centralized server to check if everything works well?</p>



<p>JK: Cryptocurrency gets its name from cryptography. Blockchains, including Qtum chain, use cryptographic hashes and algorithms to verify blockchain data&#8217;s accuracy and correctness. Most blockchains, including Qtum, use a decentralized architecture, a network of independent peers to operate the network exactly because there is no single centralized server that could lead to censorship and a host of other problems. For example, what would happen if such a centralized server when down or started corrupting the data? A centralized approach is pretty much the opposite of the cryptocurrency ethos.</p>



<p><br>Q: What are some of the benefits and advantages of offline staking? How does it differ from the classic and traditional one?</p>



<p>JN: Offline staking brings a lot of benefits to the network.</p>



<p>1. Offline staking will enable more Qtum to be part of the proof-of-stake consensus increasing the security of the network</p>



<p>2. Offline staking will allow people to earn rewards without giving up custody, which is good for staking services that don’t take custody</p>



<p>3. Anyone can be a super staker, so not only can earn yield from your own coins, but other people’s coins as well.</p>



<p><br>Q: What is the role of Qtum’s Phantom protocol? Why does Qtum’s Phantom protocol use zk-SNARKs Based on Smart Contracts?</p>



<p>JK: The main reason for choosing zk-SNARKs is that anyone will be able to make privacy tokens on the Qtum blockchain using the zk-SNARKs based on smart contracts. Another major reason is that the technology is more mature. The transactions can be fully encrypted on the blockchain and verified all while following consensus confidentially.</p>



<p><br>Q: Qtum is compatible with BTC &amp; ETH Blockchain while both are Qtum competitors; why do you choose to make both compatible with Qtum?</p>



<p>JN: Qtum chose to be compatible with BTC &amp; ETH because we didn’t want to reinvent the wheel. Building things from scratch is very costly (developers are expensive) and it presents a lot of security risks since people store value in their accounts. So even though they are our competitors, they save us time &amp; money when building Qtum &amp; make it more secure.</p>



<p><br>Q: Qtum is one of the projects that has a wonderful relationship with its community! How has the support received from your community been so far? How important is the community to Qtum?</p>



<p>JN: Community is an important part of any network, and without the community we wouldn’t know who to build for. Offline Staking was the #1 requested feature from the community, and we listened. I also think that this is the best improvement for Qtum to date. We are lucky to be supported by people from all over the world.</p>



<h2 id="qtum-s-technology-amp-community"><br>Qtum’s Technology &amp; Community</h2>



<p><br>Q: As I can see in your new updates and programs, Qtum uses the relatively rare Rust programming language. Please tell us why you have decided to use it and how important it is for the Neutron infrastructure?</p>



<p>JK: Rust is a top 20 programming language and was voted for the 5th year straight the most-loved programming language by devs in Stack Overflow’s 2020 survey. Qtum chose Rust because it is efficient for programmers to write and debug code, and is very memory safe (strongly-typed, no null pointers, no garbage collection, etc.).</p>



<p><br>Q: What did you find out while running Stake-A-Thon, a standalone Qtum Testnet test? What bugs and new features have been identified?</p>



<p>JN: So far we haven&#8217;t found any bugs on the testnet in regards to offline staking, this is the result of a ton of internal testing, an independent audit, and keeping the smart contract small. It&#8217;s only 180 lines of code so it&#8217;s easy to read through.</p>



<p><br>Q: As a credible decentralized application platform, how does Qtum deal with the issues of scalability, speed and interoperability associated with crypto currencies today?</p>



<p>JK: In terms of scalability, Qtum currently runs about 70 transactions per second, and can scale with on-chain governance (without a hard fork) to over 1,000 TPS by increasing block size. Beyond that, use layer 2 solutions like Lightning Network.</p>



<p><br>Q: What is Qtum Explorer and what is it used for?</p>



<p>JK: The Qtum Explorer at <a href="http://qtum.info">this website</a> is a blockchain explorer that shows all the data and transactions on the Qtum blockchain. A recent addition supports the offline staking info, so you can see the super stakers and delegated addresses they have received. Here is the &#8220;official pool&#8221; we are exploring in the Stake-A-Thon: <a href="https://testnet.qtum.info/address/qPooLFFk2BT3i9yKApjeJhuYjYKWHmuCdq/">official pool</a>.</p>



<p><br>Q: Will it be possible to delegate my QTUM coins to the Qtum core wallet?</p>



<p>JN: You will be able to operate a super staker from the Qtum core wallet as well as delegate from it.</p>



<p><br>Q: What advantages does Proof of Stake under uniform consensus rules bring to the Qtum blockchain as compared to proof of work that BTC uses?.</p>



<p>In this COVID19 pandemic crisis, how much progress has Qtum project had?</p>



<p>JK: Qtum has a distributed team working all over the world. As with the crypto winter, and with covid lockdowns, the team has continued to work throughout. Software development is easy to do remotely, and we can just jump on Slack and Zoom for coordination.</p>



<p><br>Q: What are the main differences and advantages of Super Staker from classic DPoS? Will the Super Staker feature be implemented in the future in Atomic Wallet?</p>



<p>JN: This is a good question because although DPoS means delegated proof-of-stake and Offline Staking allows for delegations, we believe that Offline Staking is different from DPoS networks. In DPoS there&#8217;s usually a set limit of nodes or a high requirement of coins that need to be staked. In Qtum, anyone can become a Super Staker and accept delegations, The Super Staker feature wont be integrated into Atomic Wallet because to be a Super Staker you need to be a full node, but the delegation part of Offline Staking will be integrated into Atomic Wallet!</p>



<p><br>Q: What is the maximum height that the block can reach?</p>



<p>JK: The blockchain continues to add blocks indefinitely, which is how people talk about &#8220;block height&#8221;, so there is no limit on that.</p>



<p>The size of the Qtum blocks can be adjusted through on-chain governance between 0.5 and 32 MB, currently set at 2 MB.</p>



<h2 id="qtum-s-future-plans"><br>Qtum’S Future Plans</h2>



<p><br>Q: How does the Qtum network completely hide the addresses and amounts transferred?</p>



<p>JN: It&#8217;s in the works with Phantom. You should check out this <a href="https://blog.qtum.org/qtum-phantom-protocol-unveiling-layer-2-privacy-2d31c8a527a2">blog</a> &amp; the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/156.pdf">white paper</a>.</p>



<p><br>Q: What changes will happen in the Qtum chain after the August 28 hard fork? Will users be able to delegate their Qtum coins?</p>



<p>JN: This is the key change. People can become super stakers &amp; also delegate to super stakers after the fork.</p>



<p><br>We were glad to host <a href="https://qtum.org/">Qtum</a> on our <a href="https://t.me/atomicwallet">Telegram</a>. Thanks to the team and all the members of the session!</p>

<p>Buying and selling Bitcoins are basic necessities for both new and experienced cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Peer-to-peer services such as LocalBitcoins provide a fast, easy, and safe way to trade Bitcoins in a decentralized way.</p>



<h2 id="what-is-localbitcoins-com"><br>What is Localbitcoins.com?</h2>



<p>Historically, buying and selling Bitcoins has been associated with the risk of scam. Unfortunately, dealing cryptocurrency with individuals online often results in the loss of money. This is what brought a Finnish developer Jeremias Kangas to the idea of founding Localbitcoins.<br></p>



<p><a href="https://localbitcoins.com/">Localbitcoins</a> is a p2p Bitcoin marketplace that provides a decentralized way to obtain and trade Bitcoin. Started in Helsinki in 2012, the marketplace aims to connect those willing to sell and buy Bitcoins in a peer-to-peer way &#8211; that is, via direct user interaction without third party intermediation. The website allows users to create listings (advertisements), communicate with prospective sellers and buyers and obtain confirmation of the transaction details before finalizing a trade.<br></p>



<p>LocalBitcoins.com acts as a gateway into the world of Bitcoin trading for people from different countries. Unlike centralized bitcoin trading sites and stock-like exchanges, Localbitcoins enables direct trading with individuals from all over the world. Thus, the process is lean, fast and customizable, with escrow protection ensuring safety of both traders and buyers at every stage. The website has acquired a good reputation, with the site currently listing exchangers in 15582 cities across 248 countries.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This article will guide you through the process of creating a Localbitcoins account and buying/selling Bitcoins, as well as shed light on some of the most prominent features of the website.</p>



<h2 id="sign-up-amp-log-in"><br>Sign up &amp; Log in</h2>



<p>To begin with, new users can navigate to the <em>Sign up free</em> section in the upper right corner of the website and register an account. The procedure to do that is pretty straightforward and only takes a couple of minutes. Similarly, one can click on <em>Log in</em> to access the user account.<br></p>



<h2 id="buying-bitcoins"><br>Buying Bitcoins</h2>



<p>Registered users can proceed to search for Bitcoin sellers right away. Go to the main page and fill in the search form with the amount you want to buy, your location, and the preferred payment method. If you are not sure about the latter, just choose the option <em>All online offers</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following your search, a number of potential offers from different vendors will show up. You can check the reputation, trading history, and typical response time of each vendor (indicated by the color of the circle). You can also directly communicate with them to discuss the details of the deal. Naturally, it is recommended to opt for a vendor with a better reputation and a large trading history. Once the seller has been selected, you can start the actual trade by clicking the <em>Buy</em> button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PNRAGxuvaTOZBRDZyfoDkoBCegSh6MCpZttGi6PfpwN1khwC8Y4swP8pTAvlhNze5c-790709l6dhoZhIu3DQO0yf1tOqDq9PtfaX1L_TKxzDUwNwdnL1iog3wiy6Ol3kP2KPFIX"  alt="" ></figure>



<p>Here, you will see more information about the trade. Make sure you read through the terms of the trade and agree with them; if not, just go back and choose another advertisement. To start the trade, you have to specify the amount of Bitcoins you wish to buy, (optionally) type in the message for the vendor and click the <em>Send trade request</em> button. Only click the button when you are ready to pay since the trade will be automatically canceled if you don&#8217;t transfer the money within the payment window.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/c44YNwXObe7yUM78l2ZuNd4odLmoOH2RMthJ7PJPK1MQWyT0dBk-PYpbHDzwI9SZudku5mnnJ7tqwVUas-lsUze5vGOBfvV08kbvQLzF-mK6SVJ0P9xGwRYoShuV3M8U-o7Hb3fB"  alt="" ></figure>



<p>After submitting the payment, click the <em>I have paid</em> button. Once the trader has received and verified your payment, your Bitcoin will be released from escrow and will be made available in your LocalBitcoins wallet.</p>



<p>Overall, the process is quite straightforward. Besides, in case of doubt, the page features several hints on how to begin and contact the trader, how to pay online, and how to cancel the trade.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="selling-bitcoins"><br>Selling Bitcoins</h2>



<p>Similarly, it is possible to sell your Bitcoins through the platform. For that, go to the main page and choose the <em>QUICK SELL</em> option. Fill in the amount you want to sell and choose the preferred payment platform. If unsure, choose the <em>All online offers </em>option.</p>



<p>NOTE: some payment methods are considered high-risk. Since Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, it is recommended to opt for low-risk payment methods. You can read more about the risk levels in the <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/guides/how-to-sell-bitcoins-online#toc3">Localbitcoins guide</a>.</p>



<p>Choose a trader with a large and positive trading history and click <em>Sell</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/64QtYk-t4mmS-lshjrnDTvZOPiwNGu5El3j70ogW9KvW6_dGEf8wDjVhEm0mt7ySrfn90qdyOmwxhYcd0uDV2BZalIT71HumAVegbsBELsffq6sdi_T0jN9mOaHH__HT6sGlAQXZ"  alt="" ></figure>



<p>Again, you will see more information about the trade. Make sure you read through the terms of the trade and agree with them; if not, just go back and choose another advertisement. To start the trade, you have to specify the amount of Bitcoins you wish to buy, (optionally) type in the message for the vendor and click the <em>Send trade request</em> button.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/O5bGa689ZlE4RPgRdzIGh70xDNwITIHZNfPa3lMooZ0tuH7RButtScV8miSGnMklaaEIgnwb_ftGMQgBimIciq6P_09nCejws3JfBHM6ZVDdyvTYmHW6SFQgY5qlI7ASdYkWlz8Y"  alt="" ></figure>



<p>Once you click the button, the bitcoins will be moved from your wallet to the escrow. The buyer will ask for your payment details (e.g. your bank account information). After that, the buyer will pay for the bitcoins and confirm it to you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IT IS IMPORTANT to make sure that you received the money before releasing the bitcoins. Bitcoin payments are irreversible, so there is no way to get them back even if the money from the buyer does not show up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you have received the money, you can scroll down and click the green <em>Release Bitcoins</em> button. This will complete the trade.</p>



<p>Security features of Localbitcoins</p>



<ul><li>An Escrow Service. During trading, the traded amount is sent to an escrow administration of Localbitcoins and is discharged only after the vendor confirms the funds received.</li><li>Reputation Ratings. Traders are given a ranking based on their activity that is open for all to view.</li><li>Customer Support. Localbitcoins offers quick and responsive support via email.

This provides an additional level of protection against hackers.</li></ul>



<h2 id="trading-on-localbitcoins"><br>Trading on Localbitcoins</h2>

<h2 id="localbitcoins-fees"><br>Localbitcoins Fees</h2>



<p>Localbitcoins also charges a fee of 1% that is usually taken from the sellers (or the one who posted an advertisement). However, buyers should be aware that Bitcoin prices are generally higher on Localbitcoins than on centralized exchanges. The latter are able to generate revenue by charging fees across all the trades on their platform. However, as Localbitcoins is a peer-to-peer marketplace, vendors often choose to generate revenue by slightly increasing their selling prices. Vendors are also at risk to sell Bitcoins to individuals that may try to initiate a chargeback via PayPal. As a result, they choose to set higher initial prices to mitigate the possible risks.&nbsp;<br></p>



<h2 id="takeaways"><br>Takeaways</h2>



<p>Localbitcoins is one of the fastest and easiest ways to buy and sell Bitcoins. With Localbitcoins, users worldwide can trade BTC using a selection of payment methods. Due to its peer-to-peer nature, the experience of using Localbitcoins adheres to the true principles of decentralization of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as a whole.</p>



<p>However, one shall be aware of untrustworthy buyers and sellers and take precautions to secure their trading experience. Reputable sellers, on the other hand, may ask for ID verification and refuse reversible payment methods such as Paypal. Prices may also be slightly higher in the network than on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, Localbitcoins is a tried and trusted Bitcoin trading method for both experienced cryptocurrency enthusiasts and those new to the field.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="where-to-store-bitcoins"><br>Where to store Bitcoins</h2>



<p>Localbitcoins is great for buying BTC, but storing it online is not recommended due to the possibility of hacker attacks. To ensure the safety of your funds, consider transferring them into a cryptocurrency wallet such as Atomic Wallet. It is safe, user-friendly and full of amazing features such as Atomic Swaps and crypto staking. Check it out <a href="https://atomicwallet.io/">here</a>!<br></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/lcn_ama_digest_atomic-1920x1080.png"  alt="AMA w/ LTC cover"  class="wp-image-26117" ></figure>



<p> On April 24th, <a href="https://litecoin.org/">Litecoin</a>, an open-source, global payment network that is fully decentralized without any central authorities, hosted an AMA session with us in their Telegram Chat. Our CEO Konstantin Gladych and PR Manager Christina Khachatryan were present in the discussion with the Litecoin community.<br></p>



<p>Here are the essential points of the AMA session:<br></p>



<p>Please welcome Konstantin (K), C (Christina), and the questions from the Litecoin chat members (Q).</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What do you think would be a use case for atomic swaps as a general user?</p>



<p>K: I think the best case for swaps is pegged assets. Currently, the so-called DeFi is growing on Ethereum and some other chains. But now to bring Bitcoin or Litecoin to smart contracts? Only with pegged assets. It can be done with non-custodial atomic swaps. So cross-chain 1:1 interaction is a good case where you don’t care about prices and liquidity much.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Is Atomic Wallet fully decentralized?</p>



<p>K: Atomic is a non-custodial wallet. Your private keys are encrypted and never leave your local device. This means that only you fully control your crypto which is so-called &#8220;your keys, your funds.&#8221; However, Atomic is a light wallet. We are not forcing you to run your own full node and download the blockchain. The app is connected to various nodes all over the world to get data on your balance and history and broadcast signed transactions. So it is pretty decentralized, however, less than a full node for sure. But it’s still great for most users to feel the nature of crypto.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: How does Atomic Wallet provide the most current price in the atomic swap process? Which exchanges or methods does the trade happen?</p>



<p>K: Unfortunately, we discontinued atomic swaps due to complicated support and liquidity issues. Currently, we work with various partners that are so-called non-KYC instant exchanges. At least they support lots of assets and search for the best rates. Do all background trading for you and it’s still far less risky then store your crypto on centralized exchanges.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Can we have multiple wallets integration in the future so we can restore our old Litecoin address to Atomic?</p>



<p>K: We are planning to add multiple wallets management later this year. I know many users ask us just to import old private keys in Atomic. We will also add keys to sweep soon.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What is your biggest advantage compared to other competitors like Trustwallet, Blockchain, and Exodus? Why should users choose Atomic?</p>



<p>K: Competition simply drives all of us to make better products for users. It’s a win-win for everyone. Even if I like those wallets, I believe we have better user experience and support. Atomic is trusted by over 300,000 users all over the world. We achieved this for less than two years.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: How secure is Atomic Wallet?</p>



<p>K: It’s pretty secure. We use common open-source libraries for a wallet like Bitcoin Core, Web3, etc. Your keys are encrypted and never leave your local device. However, take care of your 12 words backup. Write them down and store in a safe place, better offline.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: How do you decide which asset will be available on Atomic Wallet and which don&#8217;t?</p>



<p>K: We already support almost all top 100 assets from CoinMarketCap. However, we got a lot of requests for new asset integration. We always do our own research looking for community, technology potential, exchange volume, on-chain activity, etc.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Which countries Atomic Wallet is presently focusing on? What are your plans to expand your wallet in different regions?</p>



<p>K: Atomic Wallet has no country restrictions. However, most of our users are from the US, UK, CA, AU, DE, and other EU countries and also from Asia.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Are there any plans to support dApps?</p>



<p>K: Currently, we don&#8217;t have any plans for dApps browser support. I don’t believe in this model, too bad UI/UX. However, we will add some DeFi services in our native interface soon.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What are the advantages of Atomic Wallet over Trust Wallet?</p>



<p>K: We have a desktop and cross-chain swaps and I believe we have a better UI.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Can you share your recent achievements?</p>



<p>K: I&#8217;d say that our very recent achievement is our decentralized staking. We have already added 10 PoS assets and are planning to add 5-10 more this year.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Can you tell us how Atomic Wallet is more secure than hardware wallets?</p>



<p>K: Hardware wallets are more secure by technology but with more complicated UI and you should buy them at least. So it’s more like cold storage. Atomic is for everyday use.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What is the difference between atomic swaps and instant exchange in the wallet?</p>



<p>K: Atomic Swaps are non-custodial via time-locked contracts. Instant exchange is provided by 3rd parties.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: When will Atomic launch an IEO?</p>



<p>K: No plans for an IEO. We have been profitable for over a year.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Currently, atomic swap just supports 3-pair swapping. Do you plan to add more swapping pairs in atomic swap?</p>



<p>K: Currently, we have no plans for more pairs on atomic swaps.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: How many people are behind the success?</p>



<p>K: We have around 25 people in the team including devs, marketing, and 24/7 support. The team is distributed.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: All current projects are concerned with the speed and quantity of transactions. Old projects have also improved their network. So what else does Atomic do to bring investors?</p>



<p>C: I think we are trying to build balance in all areas, not only in the performance of our wallet but also adding new most-wanted features, promoting the product, keeping a decent customer care service, and updating the wallet regularly.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Do you have any plans to integrate private key import function?</p>



<p>K: Multiple addresses support is planned for this year. However, it is not much about privacy. Most of your addresses are linked in inputs and outputs finally on the blockchain.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Does Atomic wallet intend to include lightning network support for Bitcoin and Litecoin in the near future?</p>



<p>K: Lighting is pretty cool and it’s on the table. However, it is still a bit complicated in terms of UI/UX.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Does Atomic Wallet have any plans to partner with any exchange?</p>



<p>C: Yes, we value our reputation to be one of the best wallets for users in the market. We care about partnerships too. Hopefully, we can make our users happy with 1-3 big exchanges this year.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Which platform does Atomic Wallet use to obtain the value of each asset?</p>



<p>K: We use CryptoCompare and some other partners to provide rates.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: How&#8217;s Atomic Wallet Support when handling issues of users?</p>



<p>C: I love our support service and maybe it can sound too subjective because I work for Atomic but the people in the customer care are the best ever. Just have a problem, they&#8217;ll solve everything in a few minutes.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Are you committed to the development of the Atomic Wallet? Do you guarantee that you will not abandon the project or sell it at any price?</p>



<p>K: First, even if we decide to close Atomic, the app will still work locally on your device. You can export 12 words or private keys to any other wallet and get access to your funds. That’s how a decentralized wallet works. Second, I’m in crypto for over 5 years and a well-known public person responsible for this project personally.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What are the ways Atomic Wallet generates profits and revenue to maintain your project and what is its revenue model?</p>



<p>K: We cut some fees from each exchange or crypto purchase in a wallet. It is just a regular transactional business model.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: As I can see, the AWC token is not developing well now. Can you explain why? What are your plans to develop AWC?</p>



<p>C: Since the launch, it has made a great success and developed benefits for more than 40,000 users who participated in our affiliate, bounty, and membership campaigns. We are developing more very hot use-cases at the moment. Stay tuned.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Are you planning to start something new with LTC?</p>



<p>K: Litecoin is a cool tech that is so-called silver in crypto. However, we can’t say about any plans yet. Maybe lightning in the future.</p>

<p>On April 8th, <a href="https://qtum.org">QTUM</a>, an open-sourced blockchain application platform, hosted an AMA session with us in their <a href="https://t.me/qtumofficial">Telegram Chat</a>. Our CEO Konstantin Gladych and PR Manager Christina Khachatryan were present in the discussion with the QTUM community.<br></p>



<p>Here are the essential points of the AMA session:<br></p>



<p>Please welcome Konstantin (K), C (Christina), and the questions from the QTUM chat members (Q).</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: How safe is Atomic Wallet?</p>



<p>K: As safe as you keep your 12 words in a secure place.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Why should we use Atomic Wallet? How smooth is Atomic Wallet compared to other wallets? What is the purpose of the AWC token in Atomic Wallet?</p>



<p>K: Better to try by yourself. It has a pretty slick design. And yes we have our own token called AWC. It is for cashback rewards, affiliate programs, etc.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What’s your core tech?</p>



<p>K: Our core is based on common open-source libraries like Bitcoin Core, Web3, etc.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What makes investors, customers and users feel safe when working with AtomicWallet?</p>



<p>K: Our founders and advisors are well-known people in crypto space like Charlie Shrem and others.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Do you consider adding QTUM offline staking in Atomic Wallet in the future?</p>



<p>K: Definitely once QTUM implements offline staking, we will support this in Atomic Wallet.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: You have very important partners such as ChangeNOW, Simplex and Binance DEX. How do you evaluate the support you have received from your partners up to now and how did they contribute to Atomic Wallet&#8217;s brand value?</p>



<p>C: We focus on quality, not quantity. It is important for Atomic&#8217;s image to choose the partners and be the best for the best brands. ChangeNOW, Simplex, Binance DEX and others share our vision and it is really a delight to work together.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: You have now reached over 100K communities and users. Did you expect to have such a high community? How do you evaluate?</p>



<p>C: We are dedicated to our plans and the concept in general. So I think, yes, people who noticed us would stay with Atomic for a long time.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Can you tell us how Atomic Wallet is more secure than hardware wallets?</p>



<p>K: Hardware wallets are usually more secure by design. However, it is harder to use and you should buy the device. In Atomic Wallet, your keys are encrypted and it never leaves your device so it is well secured too.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What is your plan to attract more users? If you have sincere advice for investors, what would you recommend?</p>



<p>K: We have different channels to attract users like SEO, affiliate partnerships, PR and brand marketing. We are also seeking to expand our staking options plus we are very interested to find new fiat gateways to let people buy crypto with better rates.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What can I do with Atomic Wallet aside from storing my coins and tokens?</p>



<p>K: You can exchange most of your assets, buy more crypto, stake coins and earn rewards. Soon we will add borrow and lending options.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Is there any plan to burn some tokens of supply in the future to stabilize the price?</p>



<p>K: We have no issues with the AWC price. We are constantly buying tokens from the market using our profit.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q. Who can you see as your biggest competitors?</p>



<p>K: Our biggest competitors are Exodus Wallet, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Is the system at risk of generating the same key for another user?</p>



<p>K: Private keys are generated randomly on your local device so there&#8217;s no chance to generate the same keys.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Tell me the benefits as a user I would have from using AtomicWallet compared to other software wallets?</p>



<p>C: It is simple, supports 300+ tokens, staking, buy and exchange crypto options, and most importantly we do not store any of your data. In case of any hacking, you are safe. Just don&#8217;t share your backup phrase and private keys with anyone.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Do you plan to add more security features and options such as email verification and other forms of verification before payments are sent from the wallet?</p>



<p>K: Basically Atomic Wallet is a decentralized wallet. It is not a custody so 2FA and email verification are not effective if someone gets your 12 words backup. So make sure you have a backup in a secured place and you will be safe. From one point, you fully control your funds but also responsible for your backup safety.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: The opinion of many users says that Atomic Wallet is good but not the best option. How can you change that mentality and improve your adoption?</p>



<p>C: I guess it is about mutual effort and belief that you are doing something important. We are a great and dedicated team trying to do our best for the users. Atomic has already taken a very good position on the market.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What is the difference between atomic swaps and instant exchange in the wallet?</p>



<p>K: The difference is that atomic swap is non-custodial based on time-locked contracts. For instant exchange, you should trust your funds to external service for a short period of time.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Since the launch of the AWC token, its value has grown by more than 500%.&nbsp; Do you expect a higher value in the next few months?</p>



<p>K: I expect AWC will grow much more once the market turns to the next bull run.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Which area is Atomic focusing on at the moment?</p>



<p>K: Currently we are focusing on app quality improvement in terms of the data speed update and stability. We will also add the most popular DeFi services in our native interface like Compound DAI, etc.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Are there any new partnerships and interesting upcoming use cases?</p>



<p>K: Plenty of new assets and services will be added in Atomic this year. Partnership announcements are waiting.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What are Atomic Wallet’s transaction speed and fees? Does Atomic Wallet have any program to help users reduce transaction fees?</p>



<p>K: We do not charge any fees for transactions. You pay them to miners directly. However, you can choose between speed and cost — faster or cheaper transactions.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What is your business model now? Who are your potential customers and which markets are you targeting?</p>



<p>K: We cut some fees from each exchange and buy crypto transactions. Our target markets are US, UK, AU, CA, DE and the rest of Europe mostly. However, Atomic is available all over the world. We have no country restrictions. It is a decentralized wallet.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What type of protocol do you guys use to be an anonymous wallet?</p>



<p>K: We simply know nothing about your funds, transactions, etc. Those are stored locally on your device and blockchain only.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: How does your staking model work? How do you encourage your users to do staking?</p>



<p>K: We offer on-chain staking. Users choose validators and delegate their assets. It is so-called offline non-custodial staking. You get rewards directly from validators to your Atomic address.</p>



<p></p>

<p>
On March 18th, we had an AMA session with <a href="https://nano.org">Nano</a>, a digital currency designed to provide fast transactions, zero fees and a high level of scalability, in our <a href="https://t.me/atomicwalletchat">Telegram Chat</a>. The team members present on the discussion with our community were Colin LeMahieu (Founder &amp; CEO) and Andy Johnson (Communications Manager).<br></p>



<p>Here are the essential points of the AMA session:<br></p>



<p>Please welcome Colin (C), Andy (A) and the questions from our Telegram chat members (Q).</p>



<p></p>



<h2 id="the-nano-ecosystem-and-its-solutions">The Nano ecosystem and its solutions</h2>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Why is Nano unique among other projects providing solutions to payments?</p>



<p>C: Nano is built to be the fastest and most decentralized currency around. Our transactions settle in less than 1 second and it’s all done on a network with no fees and a tiny environmental footprint. Decentralization is an essential focus for us. Many other cryptocurrencies can get fast or low cost but they can’t also maintain decentralization which I think we do very well.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Why is Nano more sustainable than other payment solutions?</p>



<p>C: Well the sustainability comes from 2 main parts. We have a laser-sharp focus on being the most efficient currency. This means our development stays focused and eventually the number of things going into the code base will trend downward. Once we’ve achieved the goal, we just have to make things more efficient.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What is the main algorithm behind the transactions that settle in less than one second and how do you manage the transaction fees to zero?</p>



<p>C: It is a metastable bandwagon voting algorithm. Nodes announce their votes and change their own to match the winner. In this way, eventually, everyone collapses on to a single result.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Has Nano really been applied to the real world? What will convince users and businesses to use Nano for payment instead of conventional solutions?</p>



<p>A: We are seeing some strong interest in bringing Nano into the real world, beyond the familiar crypto payment platforms and into more mainstream settings.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Many cryptocurrencies have turned to wasteful energy designs to protect their networks. Nano is cleverly designed to address this problem by not relying on mining for your safety as it uses a lightweight and efficient consensus. Can you tell me about this green strategy that Nano uses?</p>



<p>A: The approach to creating Nano was to remove the inefficiencies that are clearly present in other protocols. Sustainability, rather than being a specific &#8220;green strategy&#8221;, is just a natural benefit of building something efficient from the ground up.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What remains as the hurdles to adoption?</p>



<p>A: We are happy to be sitting in a position where we can help with the more substantial hurdles to adoption, user and merchant education, regulatory clarity and helping interested and progressive mainstream businesses to identify the benefits of Nano, in comparison to other less suitable payment-focused cryptocurrencies and in some cases traditional fiat money.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What do you think about an extension of privacy into the Nano system?</p>



<p>A: Privacy is an attractive proposition to users of digital money for obvious reasons, it can be very important. Our position towards privacy is more conservative as we have seen many more hurdles to mainstream adoption being put in front of privacy-based projects. With that being said, there are eyes towards the technical implications of introducing privacy, but it is extremely difficult to do this without incurring slowdowns to settlement times.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What does a novel CAPTCHA faucet system mean and how is it different from the regular ICOs?</p>



<p>A: Rather than selling Nano via an ICO or distributing it out via mining rewards, we allowed anyone to collect Nano for free by completing those familiar security checks designed to separate humans from bots. This method of distribution has led to the growth of great Nano communities all around the world, following their participation in the CAPTCHA faucet.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Why would Nano be used as the cash version of crypto? Why would I want to buy a beer with Nano if I&#8217;m going to pay 6% more or less for the next one? What&#8217;s the strategy to make NANO easy to use?</p>



<p>C: And on simplicity, Nano is probably one of the easiest cryptocurrencies to use. There are no fees to calculate, the UX impact of entering a fee is greatly understated. How much should the fee be? Does my grandma know what network load is? What does it mean with respect to fee? Nano simply has accounts and balances, you send and it lands in their wallet in less than a second. Nothing can be simpler.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What incentives is NANO giving to us the members and what&#8217;s the reason why I and other angel investors should invest in Nano?</p>



<p>C: Nano’s value is being the fastest, most efficient currency around. Entrepreneurs make use of natural market incentives or natural efficiencies to make money on a business. Cryptocurrency has distorted that term a bit with something more closely resembling subsidies. The transaction fees and block rewards are subsidizing the security parameter and processing prioritization. PoW chains need this subsidy because their security parameter costs a lot. Additionally, we’ve seen miners work to limit the network’s throughput in order to rent-seek on the limited transaction space. The people we’re looking for are the entrepreneurs that know how to make use of a faster, lower-cost currency.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What would happen, hypothetically, if one or some of the biggest votes in terms of voting power (i.e. the biggest delegates/representatives) would broadcast contradictory votes to different parts of the network or would not broadcast a vote at all?</p>



<p>C: The security parameters assume &gt;50% of the network are good actors. Getting consensus on a particular election requires &gt;50% of the voters approve a transaction before it’s confirmed so unless &gt;50% of the network is malicious, it can’t be confirmed. The network is designed to stall in case of partitioning, nodes would wait for a confirmation quorum that never arrives.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: With the emergence of many blockchain projects, especially payment projects with the latest technology, scalability, efficiency, even without transaction fees, does Nano feel the pressure from this on the race of global blockchain payment solutions?</p>



<p>A: Of course there is a lot of competition in the space, especially around payment solutions, and we have not stopped improving the protocol. We certainly feel that Nano possesses far and away from the best fundamentals, democratic approach to decentralization, and user experience. Being fully distributed and operating on the mainnet since 2015 is also very important, and puts Nano way ahead of many other projects making bold claims about future potential. Nano is here today and works as one would expect the digital money would.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 id="nano-and-its-future-plans">Nano and its future plans</h2>



<p></p>



<p>Q: With the recent decline in the crypto market, how will Nano stand out and gain interest from new investors? Is there a new strategy by the Nano team?</p>



<p>C: Volatility is a focus with all cryptocurrencies and it comes from low volume, it’s not intrinsic to cryptocurrency itself. To cure low volume our focus is integrating it into parts of the economy where it solves a problem, rather than just emulating credit cards etc. Not having fees in the network puts us in a very good position for buying beer, for example. Typically credit card providers will charge 2-5% for a purchase, maybe even more, and it tight margin businesses that make 2-5% profit anyway. This is huge.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Can you tell us the motivation and benefits for investors to hold Nano for the long term? What are the team’s plans to make Nano a top project?</p>



<p>C: I look at the transfer of value or store of value debate this way: I see store of value as a specialized case of transfer of value, when you want to transfer the value in the future or under a future condition. I don’t think store of value can be done without first being a good transfer of value so that’s where we focus. I differentiate between investment, which has a business model and dividends, from speculation where the hope is an appreciation in the price of what you bought. Nano is not an investment, it does not pay dividends, it’s a currency to make payments and as volume increases, it will shake out its volatility.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What will Nano bring us by 2021? What are your main goals?</p>



<p>A: Settlement time reduced significantly to less than 200ms, network throughput increased, resource usage and bandwidth on nodes have been reduced, decentralization is trending upwards and Nano has been added to a wide range of well-established wallets, fiat ramps, exchanges, and payment processors.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What is the role of Coinify in the Nano ecosystem? Is this partnership the stepping stone for the exploration of DeFi?</p>



<p>C: We integrated with Coinify because our goal is to maximize the on/off ramps for Nano. They have a huge merchant network and getting added as one of their payment options opens up a lot more people to be able to pay with Nano. We’re not looking to expand into DeFi right now. I have some reservations about its viability. One thing I’ve noticed in my many years of seeing technology evolution is to not try and change 2 things at once. We don’t want to simultaneously change the currency people use and also change how finances are done.&nbsp; First, change the currency, then change the finances.</p>



<p>We were glad to host <a href="https://twitter.com/Nano">Nano</a> on our Telegram. Thanks to the team and all the members of the session!</p>

<p>J: We want to disrupt the traditional online travel agencies. Travala.com’s vision is to align travel booking with the ethos of decentralized technology. That being, promote accessibility to anyone, anywhere, offer censorship-resistant and peer-to-peer transactions, and build open-source technology controlled by software and governed by users.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Any promotions available for users right now to earn some AVA?</p>



<p>S: Yes. Invite people to join Travala.com. For every person you invite that completes a booking of US$200 or more, you will both receive US$50 worth of AVA rewards to your wallet after the invitee completes the stay at the property.

<p></p>



<p>Q: Why does travel booking need to be decentralized?</p>



<p>J: The online travel booking model was revolutionary when it arrived over 20 years ago, but in its current form is outdated. The success of disruptors such as Airbnb shows that consumers are ready to migrate to platforms that empower more reasonable pricing, allow smaller suppliers to compete more freely, and make more relevant the impact of user reputation and trustworthy reviews.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Is Travala cheaper than other booking sites?</p>



<p>J: Yes. We are normally around 15% cheaper than other mainstream travel booking sites.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Why should a customer book on Travala instead of booking directly with the hotel?</p>



<p>J: We offer better prices, more choices, more transparency and several other advantages.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What was the most surprising thing you have learned from your users?</p>



<p>J: The high engagement. Our users are extremely engaged with our brand and very valuable for us with significantly higher LTVs than industry standards.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: How do you deal with cryptocurrency payments?</p>



<p>D: We have partnerships with multiple cryptocurrency payment processors.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: How did the community bring you new opportunities as a business and how did you utilize these opportunities to build?</p>



<p>D: The community provides feedback, ideas for product and token development, referring friends and much more. We try and reward the community as much as possible.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: How can a hotel manager make a partnership with Travala&#8217;s booking services?</p>



<p>D: We plan to implement a direct contract program and decentralized travel booking platform in the future where local hotels can join the Travala.com ecosystem.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Could you share your team’s background?</p>



<p>J: Within the Travala.com team are experienced professionals in blockchain development, travel, and FinTech from some of the world’s largest companies. The majority of team members are located in Hanoi, Vietnam, whereas others are globally distributed.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What are the main factors influencing AVA prices? How can AVA be different and become a potential business?</p>



<p>D: Supply and demand. Demand is influenced by the utility of AVA and some speculation. The supply of AVA is already determined. As of lately, demand for AVA is outstripping supply which is why prices of AVA are going up.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What are the advantages of holding AVA for the long term?</p>



<p>J: AVA features front-and-center in our unique selling proposition to users. It can be used as an additional method of payment for bookings, or as the sole payment method for special offers. It can be staked for access to enhanced rewards, or directly recouped for the equivalent fiat value on partner exchanges.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Compared to the usual payment methods, what is the benefit of paying for cryptocurrencies in travel reservations for customers, partners and Travala?</p>



<p>D: Transactions fees are lower and for holders of cryptocurrency, we offer them utility. On many occasions, we have also offered special promotions for people to spend cryptocurrency such as our latest offer for 5% cashback with bookings made in Binance Coin.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Are there other ways other than the SMART rewards that have been implemented to encourage the use of AVA on the platform instead of many other payment options?</p>



<p>J: Yes. For example, we recently implemented the option to pay partially with AVA in combination with other payment options. We continue to add more use cases to the AVA token as the main pillar of the Travala.com ecosystem.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What is the primary use case of AVA token in the Travala ecosystem?</p>



<p>J: AVA’s functionality makes it critical to the success of Travala.com. The interplay of AVA use cases is designed to encourage loyalty to the Travala.com platform while increasing the distribution and liquidity of the token.</p>



<p></p>

<p></p>



<p>Q: What were the reasons that Travala migrated from NEO to Binance Chain?</p>



<p>J: The main reasons for the migration are that we wanted to improve the tokenomics of our native token (AVA) while offering faster processing times, better performance and ease of on-chain use of AVA within the platform.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: With India&#8217;s lift on crypto encumbrances today, do you have a specific plan for the nation?</p>



<p>S: Travala.com expanded partnership with an Indian travel supplier called GRNConnect, a strategic partnership expansion to help Travala.com extend its presence into the world’s second most populated country with 1.35 billion citizens.

<h2 id="travala-and-its-future-plans">Travala and its future plans</h2>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What is Travala&#8217;s mission?</p>



<p>D: Our mission is to bring to the travel industry as a whole transparent pricing, innovation, authentic truth, enhanced security, and efficient stakeholder interaction. Going forward we plan to introduce more decentralized business models to Travala.com and pass over more control to the community. This will make us the most engaging travel booking platforms around.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: How much do you believe in the future of cryptocurrency in the travel industry?</p>



<p>J: We believe paying for travel and other major services with crypto will be the norm in the future so we aim to position ourselves as the go-to destination for any travel-related bookings.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What are Travala&#8217;s plans to weather the economic standstill in travel that is slowly occurring due to the Coronavirus outbreaks?</p>



<p>J: We hope to see an increase in local travel, particularly accommodation bookings, instead of international travel and hopefully our growth traction will outweigh the negative impact of the reduction of international travel. In any case, we have a long way to go so we will keep building!</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What are Travala&#8217;s plans on how to attract users who don&#8217;t know anything about cryptocurrency?</p>



<p>D: We offer common fiat booking methods and plan to implement more marketing strategies aimed at the masses. It takes time to build a user base, but so far we are doing a good job. Any help with spreading the word is always appreciated!</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What makes you feel confident about the survival and sustainable success of Travala in the far future?</p>



<p>J: The growth to date has been significant and driven organically so we&#8217;re confident that the current growth levels, combined with a clear strategy and execution plan by a team of experienced professionals in blockchain development, travel, and FinTech from some of the world’s largest companies will make us successful.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: Are there any plans to add more services to Travala in the future?</p>



<p>D: Yes. We plan to offer more travel verticals. It is important for us to be very strong in one vertical before adding more. Flights, rental cars, activities and more are in the pipeline.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: What improvement can you expect in the travel industry in the future with the contribution of Travala?</p>



<p>D: Promote accessibility to anyone, anywhere, offer censorship-resistant and peer-to-peer transactions and build open-source technology controlled by software and governed by users.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: History has proven that the best technology doesn’t always win. Bitcoin has a ten-year head start in marketing and mainstream adoption. How will Travala catch-up?</p>



<p>J: Travala.com is focusing on a niche market within travel booking and we&#8217;re not competing with Bitcoin or any other major digital asset in the market, it&#8217;s actually the opposite. We process over 25% of our total bookings in Bitcoin. We&#8217;re aiming to play a key role in bringing adoption to the masses and we believe that travel will be crucial for this.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Q: To what extent Travala can introduce itself and master travel finance in major countries?</p>



<p>J: Travala.com is already present in over 230 countries worldwide. We have achieved a global presence with 90% organic growth to date so we hope we will continue to extend our reach globally over the next few years as we consolidate our position as market leaders within blockchain travel.</p>
