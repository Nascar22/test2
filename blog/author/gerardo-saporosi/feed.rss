										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ethereum is a decentralized smart contract platform that allows developers to build decentralized applications (dapps) that run on the platform. It is the largest blockchain to date by far, and its native ETH token is the second largest currency in market capitalization of the crypto sphere, behind Bitcoin. Will Bitcoin be surpassed by Etherum, what&#8217;s Ethereum Price Prediction 2021?</p>



<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum are two totally different projects. Bitcoin is only used to make payments. Ethereum developed an EVM, Ethereum Virtual Machine that consists of a gigantic Turing complete computer, distributed throughout the planet among thousands of nodes, which allows doing anything, such as, for example, manage insurance, real estate, games, logistics, commercial networks, basically, everything that an individual computer allows to do, in a decentralized way, without intermediaries that can steal your data or censor you.</p>



<p>Bitcoin is a Postnet, it can only make payments. Ethereum is a Smartphone, it can run any application. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, Ethereum is a token.</p>



<p>As of this writing, on Feb 12, 2021, the Ethereum current price is $ 1,737.88. A year ago, the ETH price was around $ 200. During the bull run of early 2021, the Ethereum coin price soared wildly.</p>



<p>You can handle Ethereum, plus 500 other currencies in the Atomic Wallet interface.</p>



<h3 id="what-is-ethereum-eth"><strong>What is Ethereum (ETH)</strong></h3>



<p>Ethereum is an idea by Vitalik Buterin dating back to 2013. In his whitepaper he presents a totally novel concept for blockchain technology, describing Ethereum as a globally distributed computer for running programs and storing data. Vitalik continues to lead the project to this day. Gavin Wood, another of Ethereum&#8217;s more well-known founders, wrote the Ethereum yellow paper but left the project in 2016 to start working on another blockchain project called Polkadot.</p>



<p>At the Ethereum launch, which took place in 2014, the team proposed a public sale of the native token “Ether” (ETH), and they raised more than $ 18 million, making it the largest token sale to date. A year later, the Ethereum mainnet finally saw the light. Today in 2021, Ethereum is still in deep development, being the subject of great technological developments.</p>



<p>Ether (ETH) is the native currency of the Ethereum network and has many uses cases: it serves as gas for network transactions, it is a digital store of value, it can be traded and exchanged on all Cex and Dex exchanges, and it can be used as payment currency. Many analysts say that ETH is the only cryptocurrency that acts simultaneously as a store asset, as a commodity, and as a capital asset.</p>



<p>ETH is an inflationary currency. Unlike Bitcoin which has a maximum emission of 21 million, the emission of ETH has no limit. As long as the PoW consensus protocol lasts (until ETH 2.0 is fully implemented and goes to PoS), miners receive new issued ETH each time a block is processed, verified, and added to the Ethereum blockchain. The production process of a new block takes approximately 13 seconds, and the block reward is currently 2 ETH per block.</p>



<p>It is expected that as time goes by, the inflation rate of ETH will decrease, and when Ethereum 2.0 consolidates alongside Proof of Stake (PoS), ETH is not going to be mined with computational power anymore. Instead of the miners, there will be &#8220;validators&#8221; who must deposit their ETH tokens, and the PoS protocol will determine which participants are selected to validate blocks and earn staking rewards. Ethereum 2.0 will require validators to run a validator node and stake a minimum of 32 ETH to participate in the network. The rate of return for staking in ETH is expected to be around 4% to 10%.</p>



<p>1 ETH can be divided into smaller units called Gwei.</p>



<p>1 Gwei = 0.000000001 ETH</p>



<p>The Gwei unit is the most used to calculate the price of gas in transactions on the Ethereum network.</p>



<h3 id="ethereum-price-chart"><strong>Ethereum Price Chart</strong></h3>



<p>The Ethereum price USD has come a long way. In March 2016, after its launch, the Ethereum coin price was around $ 11. In March 2017, the price almost doubled, reaching $ 20. In March 2018, after the ICO fever (which could take place thanks to Ethereum creating the platform), the Ethereum coin price reached almost $ 700. Then, like all currencies, it suffered a sharp drop, and in March 2019 it reached $ 135. ETH value stayed at that price for a year, trading in March 2020 at around $ 200. Today, in February 2021, the ETH price is $ 1800 and the truth is that the predictions indicate a sustained increase, as we explain below.</p>



<p>In the following chart, you can see the evolution of the ETC price in the last year.</p>

<h3 id="market-prediction-for-ethereum-eth"><strong>Market prediction for Ethereum (ETH)</strong></h3>



<p>There are good reasons to believe that Ether will continue to climb in price in 2021.</p>



<p>Ethereum is the number one platform for developing blockchain projects and launching decentralized applications. Each transaction generates network commissions paid in ETH. And as network growth rates remain high, we can confidently expect the continuation of ETH&#8217;s &#8220;bullish&#8221; trend. Interest in ETH is increasing, as is the number of active wallets, the number of transactions on the network, and the average transaction size. Corporations are starting to look at ETH as they already did with BTC.</p>



<h3 id="opinions"><strong>Opinions</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ryan-Berckmans-eth-price-prediction.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33968" ></figure>



<p><strong>Ryan Berckmans.</strong> With current average transaction prices hovering around $ 25, Ethereum is virtually unusable for the average operator or DeFi user. The current level of gas rates should reflect an asset price of USD $ 2,500. There are plans to alleviate these very high fees with an early Ethereum upgrade proposal called EIP-1559. Once this happens, according, some of the fees will begin to accrue for ETH holders through a burning mechanism that could push its price up to $ 20,000.</p>

<p><strong>Andrew Keys </strong>is quite optimistic in his predictions for 2021, stating that next year will see cryptocurrencies take a more important position on the global political and economic scene. Investors start to accept Bitcoin as the new &#8216;digital gold&#8217;, and Ethereum as the &#8216;digital oil&#8217;, thanks to the growing importance of smart contracts created on the ETH Blockchain. Keys expects Ethereum to be able to achieve a price of $ 2,000 in 2021. Essentially due to the same causes that would drive the price of Bitcoin, that is, the entry of institutional investors attracted by the advantages that Ethereum 2.0 offers for the creation of Blockchain projects on the ETH chain.</p>

<p><strong>Tyler Winklevoss. </strong>Many companies are built on the cloud, for example paying Amazon with fiat. On the Ethereum network, dapps pay with ETH. If we consider Bitcoin as gold, we have to consider Ethereum as oil. If Ethrerum succeeds as a decentralized layer of apps across the globe, it may have the same market capitalization as gold which is 9 trillion. With Ethererum currently holding 80 billion market capitalization, that would mean Ethereum could hit $ 75,000 per coin.</p>

<p><strong>Lark Davis. </strong>With the upgrade proposal, by burning fees, a bullish force is created in the price of ETH, which can cause the coin to reach more than $ 3,000 at the end of February-March 2021. “I am very bullish.

<h3 id="ethereum-eth-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Ethereum (ETH) price prediction 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Many analysts predict that a parabolic trajectory rally for ETH may be imminent, due to the growing fundamentals of the Ethereum DeFi network and ecosystem. The total value locked on DeFi platforms since the beginning of 2020 has grown by almost 3,300%, from $ 687 million to $ 23.2 billion. And Ethereum is the mainnet for the creation and launch of most new DeFi projects and stablecoins.</p>



<p>In December 2020, phase 0 of Ethereum 2.0 began. Phases 1 and 2 will launch in 2021 and 2022. Ethereum 2.0 is the most important upgrade Ethereum has had so far, introducing two major improvements: Proof of Stake (PoS) and Shard Chains. PoS will not use miners, but the network will be validated by &#8220;validators&#8221; (virtual miners) who deposit ETH as a stake. PoS is expected to improve security, scalability, and power efficiency. With Shard Chains, the Ethereum blockchain will be separated into several separate chains that will work in parallel and connect to each other seamlessly, dividing the responsibility for data processing among many nodes. This parallel processing (instead of the consecutive one of the previous PoW), will strongly increase the throughput of the chain.</p>



<p>The main use case of Ethereum today is to grant gas to the operations carried out by the applications of the DeFi ecosystem.</p>



<p>DeFi (decentralized finance) is probably the most famous ecosystem in the crypto-sphere. It is composed of protocols, digital assets, smart contracts, liquidity pools, decentralized exchanges (DEX), currency swap platforms, and thousands of decentralized applications (dapps) that carry out financial operations in a decentralized blockchain environment, such as blockchain-based borrowing and lending, automated token exchanges, decentralized prediction markets, synthetic assets, no-loss lottery&#8217;s, staking, yield farming, peer-to-peer payment systems, stablecoins and various other strategies that shape an ecosystem of new finance and new classes of assets. DeFi is not a replica of traditional finance in a blockchain environment, but a totally new and accessible new class of finance, without permission, without censorship and without intermediaries.</p>



<p>The vast majority of DeFi dapps run on the Ethereum network. This speaks clearly of the future value of ETH, as the TLV (Total Locked Value) in DeFi grows exponentially day by day. By leveraging the Ethereum blockchain, DeFi dapps are freeing up new liquidity pools and creating new non-existent and unknown business opportunities, while increasing security and transparency and the entry of new players, previously excluded by traditional systems of minimums and restrictions unattainable by the common man.</p>



<p>CME Group, one of the largest derivatives exchanges, will launch its ETH derivatives product in February 2021, which is expected to attract a significant flow of institutional money. ETH looks very bullish and has the potential to outperform BTC in 2021. ETH price is forecasted between $ 1600 and $ 1800 at the end of Q1 2021. Notably, ETH price parabolic projections of around $ 10,000 are available in many prediction reports of prices.</p>

<h3 id="ethereum-eth-price-prediction-2025"><strong>Ethereum (ETH) price prediction 2025</strong></h3>



<p>Ethereum is following alongside an early Bitcoin fractal, showing similar investor behavior and price patterns. Bitcoin tripled bottomed, while Ethereum has formed a double bottom. A similar trajectory as Bitcoin’s would take the price per Ethereum to as high as $ 70,000 per coin at the peak of the next bull market.</p>

<h3 id="ethereum-price-prediction-verdict"><strong>Ethereum price prediction verdict</strong></h3>



<p>There are several things we can be sure of:</p>



<p>a) Ethereum&#8217;s value is unlikely to fall sharply</p>



<p>b) The development of ETH 2.0 will boost the growth of the ETH price</p>



<p>c) Ethereum will gain more attention from institutional investors</p>



<p>Ethereum remains 50% off its 2017 ATH. The growing interest and growing demand for Ethereum will definitely push the value towards its ATH at some point in time, and 2021 may be that time.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/What-is-Uniswap-min-1920x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33850" ></figure>



<p>UNI is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain that offers control over the Uniswap protocol&#8217;s governance<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-uniswap" rel="noreferrer noopener">.</a></p>



<p>Uniswap is an automated market maker (AMM) platform and decentralized exchange (DEX), built on the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-ethereum-blockchain" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum network,</a>&nbsp;which offers a non-custodial trade of ERC-20 tokens. Below we explain what a DEX and an AMM are. The first version (Uniswap v1) was released in November 2018, and the second (Uniswap v2) was released in May 2020.</p>



<p>Uniswap v1 only accepts ERC-20 token exchange. Uniswap v2 allows many groups like USDC / BUSD, DAI / KNC, or DAI / ETH. The aggregation of unique pairings can lead to fewer &#8220;trade-offs&#8221; from a user&#8217;s perspective, ultimately improving price execution by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/ethereum-network-fees" rel="noreferrer noopener">reducing gas commissions,</a>&nbsp;liquidity fees, and slippage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Uniswap v2 also includes a protocol change, allowing UNI token holders to charge 0.05% of the exchange fee versus 0.25% for liquidity providers and a new pricing oracle logic, flash exchanges, and a change in the contract architecture.</p>



<p>&nbsp;This post briefly explains how the UNI token works and its usefulness in the DeFi ecosystem.</p>



<h2 id="what-is-uni-coin"><strong>What is UNI Coin?</strong></h2>



<p>UNI was born from the need for Uniswap to provide its users the possibility of earning tokens by injecting liquidity into the protocol.</p>



<p>On September 16, 2020, the launch was made through an airdrop to Uniswap users who had interacted with the platform before September 1, either through swapping tokens or providing liquidity.</p>



<p>The first use case of the UNI token is that it is used as a governance token. This allows all UNI holders to vote on key issues that can have a serious impact on the direction Uniswap takes, which will surely impact the token price. Also, the management of the treasury will be in charge of the community.</p>



<p>The UNI token also provides liquidity on Uniswap, as liquidity providers (LPs) can provide their UNI along with an equivalent amount of ETH.</p>



<p>Uniswap showed a marked growth after the launch of the second version of its protocol, where UNI is created with a genesis issuance of 1 billion tokens that will be distributed over four years. 40% goes to investors and advisers and the team members themselves. The remaining 60% goes to members of the project community. After that, the project will see an inflation rate of 2% per year. All users who had used any Uniswap service before September 1, 2020, received 400 UNIs worth about $ 4.25, a total of about $ 1,700. Today&#8217;s market price for a UNI is $ 4.88.</p>



<h2 id="brief-history"><strong>Brief History</strong></h2>

<p>The Uniswap project starts after a series of posts made by Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, especially on his Reddit account, in the years 2017/18. He suggested creating a DEX on Ethereum and spoke of something unknown until then, which were the automated market makers, AMM.</p>



<p>These ideas were collected by Hayden Adams to create Uniswap and transform it into what is today, one of Ethereum&#8217;s largest DeFi ecosystems. Hayden Adams is an expert in simulation and design in the automotive and aerospace industries. You can see his LinkedIn profile&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/haydenadams/" rel="noreferrer noopener">at this link</a>.<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/haydenadams/" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;</a></p>



<h2 id="uni-technology"><strong>UNI Technology</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/uniswap-exchange-liquidity-min-1920x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33828" ></figure>



<p>UniSwap uses an algorithm that automatically assigns the applicable exchange rate based on the relationship between tokens and exchange demand.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s define some basic concepts.</p>



<p>• What is a DEX? A DEX is a decentralized exchange. The difference with a centralized exchange is that, in a DEX, the swap operation is carried out in a decentralized way through smart contracts, without a centralizing entity to guarantee the operation. The custody of the coins is the responsibility of the owner.</p>



<p>• What is an AMM? In traditional markets, there is the figure of the &#8220;market maker,&#8221; which is a person or entity that injects money into a market to activate it. Most often, it is a bank or financial institution. An AMM represents this figure but in a decentralized way. Uniswap&#8217;s AMM works under an original design called CPMM, Constant Product Market Maker. A user can deposit his/her cryptos in a pool through a pair, for example, DAI / ETH, and that money can be used by another user to make another trade. In return, the liquidity provider receives part of the transaction fees in proportion to the money contributed. This was the basis for Uniswap&#8217;s spectacular growth, giving rise to the phenomenon known as liquidity mining. The formula is very simple x * y = k, where &#8220;x&#8221; and &#8220;y&#8221; are the deposited amounts of the pair of cryptocurrencies, and &#8220;k&#8221; is a constant.</p>



<p>• What is a liquidity pool? It is a reserve of funds created by the deposits of contributors who seek profitability for their cryptocurrencies. The objective of Uniswap is to obtain liquidity from some users so that others carry out their operations without depending on anyone. Uniswap design allows users to create pools of liquidity with which traders can quickly trade. A user can deposit his/her cryptocurrencies in a liquidity pool (e.g., DAI / ETH), and that money is used by other people who want to make exchanges. In return, depositors receive part of the transaction fees depending on the amount they have deposited.</p>



<p>This particular operation led Uniswap to reach incredible volumes since this injection of liquidity means more profits for users, giving rise to a very fashionable phenomenon at the moment: liquidity mining. In this way, a win-win is generated: traders experience better transactions, and depositors in pools take commissions for providing liquidity.</p>



<p>These pools are configured so that the depositor must enter two tokens (e.g., ETH and DAI). The purpose of this is to create a balanced and balanced liquidity system that allows the creation of interesting exchange options for the platform&#8217;s users.</p>



<p>Thus, if liquidity providers open a DAI / ETH pool, they must deposit value in both DAI and ETH. Once the pool is created, it will be listed so that users can exchange that pair.</p>



<h2 id="advantages-of-uniswap"><strong>Advantages of Uniswap</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  alt="" ></figure>



<p>&#8211; It is decentralized.</p>



<p>&#8211; Any ERC-20 token can be exchanged.</p>



<p>&#8211; It is open source.</p>



<p>&#8211; Trading is relatively inexpensive.</p>



<p>&#8211; Liquidity pools offer good returns for depositors.</p>



<h2 id="disadvantages-of-uniswap"><strong>Disadvantages of Uniswap</strong></h2>



<p>Like most DeFi initiatives, the protocol is in an experimental phase, so the risk is high.</p>



<p>&#8211; Ethereum&#8217;s scalability problems make the price of gas very high.</p>



<p>&#8211; The UNI token is distributed and traded as security. This could serve as an argument for possible intervention by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>&#8211; It is possible to list fake tokens. You need to be very alert.</p>



<h2 id="perspectives-and-takeaways"><strong>Perspectives and Takeaways</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  alt="" ></figure>



<p>The advent of government tokens has incentivized members across the cryptocurrency industry to educate themselves and pushed the concept of DEX as a whole. In monetary terms, they are also why the crypto industry has gone from $ 1 billion total locked value (TLV) in DeFi at the end of 2019 to well over $ 13.5 billion at the end of 2020.</p>



<p>Uniswap was very timely in launching its UNI government token because DeFi faces many challenges. DeFi is the most competitive industry on the planet. Ethereum is enduring great pressure caused by network congestion, and the current price of gas is unbearable. If Ethereum 2.0 doesn&#8217;t show quick results, the industry will surely be looking for new blockchains to trade on.</p>



<p>That is why the community&#8217;s vote is very necessary since the interested parties themselves will seek the best solution for their money.</p>



<p>The introduction of the UNI token and the massive airdrop, in a way, was expected by the market. This new asset allows the platform to have an internal governance mechanism. Something like a loyalty program mixed with company shares: Uniswap users receive rewards for contributing to the platform, as well as a vote on how the protocol is executed.</p>



<p>Uniswap grew a lot as a decentralized exchange (DEX) after the launch of the second version of this protocol v2, where UNI is created with a genesis issuance of 1 billion tokens distributed over four years. UNI hodlers can submit a governance proposal in the initial stages of governance, delegating 1% of the total UNI supply, i.e., 10,000,000 UNI tokens.</p>



<p>The first use case of the UNI token is that it is used as a governance token. This allows all UNI holders to vote on key issues that can have a serious impact on the direction Uniswap takes, which can ultimately have a huge impact on price action (PA). The treasury will be managed by the community, which is very good news for UNI holders.</p>



<p>The UNI token also provides liquidity on Uniswap, as liquidity providers can provide their UNI along with an equivalent amount of ETH to take a portion of all fees paid when a user buys or sells tokens.</p>



<p>Several analysts consider that UNI&#8217;s launch by Uniswap is a direct response to its recent competitor SushiSwap. This protocol copied Uniswap and took a lot of activity out of it. Uniswap and SushiSwap have the fourth and fifth-highest value blocked in their protocols, respectively.</p>



<p>As a note of color, following the airdrop, Uniswap and UNI moved $ 650,000 in&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/ethereum-network-fees" rel="noreferrer noopener">gas rates</a>&nbsp;in just three hours. The Ethereum network went berserk, and fees soared. Ethereum miners had a new record for combined revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;The recent announcement of the imminent release of UniSwap v3 also caused great anticipation. Uniswap v3 is an update that has been rumored for a long time.</p>



<p>Uniswap announced in August an $ 11 million Series A round led by Andreessen Horowitz with additional investments from USV, Paradigm, Variation A single, Variant, Parafi Cash, SV Angel, and A.Funds. The premise of the Series A round was to provide the team with the resources to &#8220;grow and build Uniswap V3, which will greatly increase the flexibility and efficiency of the protocol capital.&#8221;</p>



<p>While there have been no official announcements of the update, various members of the Ethereum community have been creating quite a stir on Twitter lately by posting analysis of what is about to happen.</p>



<p>In the founder&#8217;s words, this new version will focus on the lag and efficiency issues currently facing Uniswap v2 users.</p>



<p>No specific details have been released on how this will be achieved. Still, the Uniswap founder mentioned dynamic trading fees, the ability to create trading pairs without the participation of both sides of the market, and extremely low slippage levels.</p>



<p>The development team also intends to make Uniswap easier to use by including its educational content.</p>



<h2 id="6-uni-info"><strong>6. UNI info</strong></h2>



<p><strong>UniSwap Website</strong></p>



<p>For the ultimate source of information, visit: Uniswap&#8217;s Official Website</p>



<p><strong>UniSwap Twitter</strong></p>



<p>Follow @UniswapProtocol on Twitter to keep up with the latest updates.</p>



<p><strong>UniSwap Reddit</strong></p>



<p>Join UniSwap&#8217;s subreddit r/UniSwap to discuss the currency with the rest of the community.</p>



<p><strong>7. How to store and manage UNI</strong></p>



<p>You can manage and exchange UNI anonymously and securely in&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-uniswap" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomic Wallet.</a></p>



<p>UniSwap (UNI) is supported by multiple wallet providers, including&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/erc20-wallet" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomic Wallet</a>. In Atomic Wallet, you can manage and exchange UNI. Atomic Wallet empowers you with full control over your funds since your Private Keys are protected with a mnemonic seed and never leave your device. Atomic Wallet provides you with one of the best options to manage and exchange UNI. Install the app now and manage your UNI right in the Atomic Interface.</p>



<p><strong>8. Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>Uniswap is undoubtedly one of the most important decentralized Ethereum applications. A decentralized exchange powered by an automated market-making system has quickly become the largest consumer of gas on the blockchain. Uniswap regularly processes more than 100,000 transactions with a volume of hundreds of millions each day.</p>



<p>&nbsp;UniSwap has proven to be one of the flagship products in an ultra-competitive environment such as DeFi. I believe that the team will continue to develop new solutions on an ongoing basis. The v3 update is already on the way. Number One Hayden Adams has stated that the new v3 version &#8220;will eat UniSwap v2&#8217;s lunch&#8221;. I think UniSwap is going to remain at the forefront of the DEX race for a long time.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image1.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-32360" ></figure>



<p><strong>Dogecoin&nbsp;</strong>is a cryptocurrency of great functional relevance, which gained popularity and adoption among crypto-users worldwide. The history behind this meme coin — in particular &#8211; is not without controversies, yet original and uncommonly surprising. Let’s learn a bit more about Dogecoin’s past narrative to understand more about the actual features and shape of the “sardonic” Dog’s coin par excellence.</p>



<p>DogeCoin’s mascot’s name is “Doge.”</p>



<h3 id="brief-history-of-dogecoin"><strong>Brief History of DogeCoin</strong></h3>



<p>Dogecoin’s birth year dates back to 2013. Its birthplace is Portland, Oregon (a federal state that’s more commonly associated with its colonial wild-west past and related gunslingers showdown movie scenes than cryptocurrency projects). 2013 was a year marked by the race towards the creation of new cryptocurrencies. The then project’s founders, Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, started DogeCoin almost as a pun, combining two of the hottest topics at the time — the dog meme coupled with the cryptocurrency concept. Since the beginning, the project’s mascot (and lucky charm) is the “Doge, “a seemingly eye-giggling Shiba Inu. It&#8217;s picture stands out as the coin’s symbol and which is often used on web memes, as well as any application related to the coin, highlighting the funny &amp; user-friendly nature of this cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Despite its playful/joking inception, DogeCoin almost immediately managed to attract quite some attention. Both Markus and Palmer kept on conveying the sarcastic imprint about the coin, which would act as a sort of commentary to the unrealistic hype and the barrage of new cryptocurrencies coming out at the time. At the same time, the duo managed to partially steer from this funny dog-currency direction &amp; aim to a more accessible, utility-charged one that users would eventually utilize with much more ease to many other competing coins &#8211; as an online deposit cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>DogeCoin’s popularity has risen in time thanks to its stability and low price (due to the unlimited supply of the coin), which made it easy to use to do transactions.</p>



<p>Though, the coin’s history has not been without turmoil — during December 2013, millions of Doges were stolen by a hacker and then recovered thanks to community donations. Adding up to that, in 2015, Jackson Palmer left the community indefinitely, defining the community as “toxic,” after a supposedly Doge user (Alex Green) was indicted for money laundering.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-32371" ></figure>



<p>Elon Musk has frequently made humorous tweets about DogeCoin.</p>



<p>Yet, despite these black swan events, and despite the last substantial update being released two years ago, DogeCoin’s ascension has kept following a gradual upward spiral in terms of recognition, by becoming &#8211; by January 2014 &#8211; Reddit’s official and regularly used coin, at each Reddit user’s disposal. Its popularity was furthered by Elon Musk’s frequent sound-off and tweeting about the meme coin, causing (even with<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1340590280848908288?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;his latest sarcastic tweet about DOGE</a>) occasional spikes in the quotation, as well several renowned fundraising initiatives: Doge4Water, NASCAR, and even the notorious 2014 Jamaican bobsled team sponsorship for the Winter Olympics (for which the project even managed to raise an astounding sum of circa 129.000 dollars).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-32382" ></figure>



<p><em>The Jamaican bobsled team and “Doge.”</em></p>



<p>Today $DOGE is still and mainly used as a “pure” currency for payments thanks to its low unit price &#8211; which serves users as a mere efficient currency compared to other competing payment cryptos and trading/capital gain purposes.</p>



<p><strong>Dogecoin’s Technology and Advantages</strong></p>



<p>As we’re all well aware, nowadays, the actual number of cryptocurrencies in circulation in the crypto universe is in the magnitude of thousands. It’s often tough to identify projects that might be successful, especially when compared to more capitalized and established platforms, which usually bear with them structurally acknowledged technology and more substantial competitive advantages.</p>



<p>Dogecoin can be ascribed to such category of battle-tested projects, given its<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/academy/cryptocurrency-algorithm" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;underlying technological infrastructure</a>&nbsp;harking back to Bitcoin (Dogecoin implemented scrypt technology as well), but also bringing forth several important differences (e.g., by requiring dedicated FPGA and ASIC chips for mining), which mark a substantial improvement compared many of the Orange Coin’s features.</p>



<p><strong>The Pros</strong></p>



<p>First of all, Dogecoin’s transaction and validation protocol is relatively fast and often requires less than a minute to add a new block to the (Doge)chain, which is much quicker than Bitcoin or even Litecoin block-time.</p>



<p>Secondly, unlike Bitcoin or<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/ama-litecoin-community" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Litecoin</a>, there is no maximum number of minable $DOGEs — as outlined earlier in the article, the supply is unlimited.</p>



<p>Thirdly, Dogecoin is one of the most traded cryptocurrencies in terms of absolute values (circa 500k USD as the 24-hour trading volume at the time of writing). This statement refers not merely to the speculative trading (which represents more than 80% of the total $DOGE transactions) and all the transactions that involve “real” exchange between users for a service/product in return for the corresponding sum of $DOGE. At the moment, there are more than 1000+ companies that accept Dogecoin as means of virtual payment, including many products/services categories.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image1-1.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-32393" ></figure>



<p><em>Dogecoin is backed by a solid, dedicated, worldwide community. Its members are known as “Shibes,”</em></p>



<p><strong>What about the Cons?</strong></p>



<p>While Dogecoin has great potential, there is also some seemingly community-vocalized limit to the project (on which many would disagree, though): the underlying mining technology, analogous to<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/bitcoin-explained" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Bitcoin</a>, utilizes the proof-of-work algorithm, which is seen as expensive in terms of energy and computer equipment/resources costs. There have been several proposals inside the Dogecoin community, asking for a change towards a block verification model that’s more similar to Ethereum’s, such as<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/proof-of-stake-vs-proof-of-work" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;proof-of-stake</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-32404" ></figure>



<p><em>A true meme coin</em></p>



<p><strong>Perspective and Takeaways</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dogecoin — Notable Personalities &amp; Social Media</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dogecoin&nbsp;</strong>managed to capture the attention of many users online in the cryptocurrency world, especially (as stated previously) after several acknowledgments from Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk.</p>



<p>It has inspired so many memes and, despite being “initiated as almost a prank coin,” since then, it has managed to grow an incredible community, especially on Twitter and Reddit.</p>



<p>Elon Musk has actively spoken about Dogecoin, even though some of his tweets could have been considered contradictory. In April 2019, Musk tweeted that Dog’s coin could be “his” favorite cryptocurrency, after stating that he found it pretty. In December 2020, he even changed his Twitter bio as “Ex Dogecoin’s CEO,” then<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/swapzoneio/status/1340617001220231169?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;followed up by tweeting</a>:</p>



<p><em>“One word: DOGE.”</em></p>



<p>This tweet alone seemed to have spurred a 20% value increase on Binance. Recently though, on January 9th, 2021, when questioned by a Twitter follower whether he had already investments in $DOGE, he replied with “maybe one day.”</p>



<p><strong>Dogecoin and Tik Tok</strong></p>



<p>Instead, “flaunted” the hostage<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dogecointo1dollar&amp;src=typeahead_click" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;#dogecoininto1dollar</a>, advancing a potentially bright future for $DOGE.</p>



<p>As we know, dozens of online shops and sellers accept $DOGE as means of payment. Many users who want to be empowered with the chance of using cryptocurrencies to pay want to have the possibility to use $DOGE.</p>



<p>Several crypto influencers and internet stars have been proposing to further Dogecoin’s strategical influence via social media platforms, among which Tik Tok. Among these social media personalities and Instagram model<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/CorinnaKopf/status/1347683809651671040?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Corinna Kopf who, on January 9th, 2021, tweeted</a>:</p>



<p><em>“Dogecoin needs to go viral on Tit Tok.”</em></p>



<p>Ms. Kopf constantly tweets about Dogecoin, having mentioned it many times in the past as well. Her followers and hodlers of the Dog’s cryptocurrency expected a newer and even greater chance to<a target="_blank" href="https://fortune.com/2020/07/09/tiktok-dogecoin-challenge/" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;a Doge’s price pump challenge on TikTok</a>.</p>



<p>On Tok Tok, on July 2020, after a week of non-stop viral videos, the price of $DOGE witnessed a 30% spike in price, peaking to more than 1800% trade volume variation.</p>



<p>One more fun fact that celebrates Dogecoin as one of the most transversely favorite cryptocurrencies among many influencers &amp; personalities and in many various sectors: at the beginning of this year, adult performer<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ANGELAWHITE/status/1345197408448204800?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Angela White tweeted that she’s been a holder of $DOGE since 2014</a>, showing amazing patience as an investor, also reaping a lot of the coin’s gains over the years, thanks to the market exuberance, after which Dogecoin’s price more than doubled.</p>



<p><strong>Dogecoin e DeFi</strong></p>



<p>There’s also another excellent news for Dogecoin’s loyalists: On January 7th, 2021, $DOGE finally managed to land on<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-ethereum-blockchain" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Ethereum</a>, thanks to pNetwork’s support.</p>



<p>Adding a piece to the<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-decentralization" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;DeFi</a>&nbsp;puzzle: as many know already, the volatile markets marking the period that led to the last days of July 2020 managed to spark and gather even more focus &amp; attention on Ethereum’s DeFi’s from users throughout the crypto space. Many cryptocurrencies have been riding on the crest of the bull wave, with a surge in the magnitude of dozens, if not hundreds of percentage points of value (and in some cases even more) in the last months. While not directly &amp; “properly” tied to the DeFi space, there is an indirect correlation between the DeFi growth and Doge’s. As long as the trend is bullish, the time has proven that this will also reflect positively (in terms of value increase — and therefore market capitalization) on the most established coins, along which $DOGE is another co-protagonist.</p>



<p><strong>Vantage Points</strong></p>



<p>$DOGEs will continue to be minted indefinitely — even though with a lower minting rate — on Dogechain. The combination of all these factors might suggest that DOGE’s rally might signal the beginning of a new cycle of the coin in the next future.</p>



<p>The fact that this cryptocurrency turned to the crypto markets with sarcasm does not imply that it’s a non-credible project. Instead, it can boast an ecosystem that’s within everyone’s reach. DOGE’s mascot — the cute Shiba Inu portrayed on the characteristic image of the coin — served and still serves to showcasing the ludic facet of the meme coin to make it more delicious. After all, it’s not possible to consider $DOGE as a joke anymore, given its 1+ billion dollars of market cap. And that’s also why there’s not much to be amazed about if “the DOGE” enjoys such fame and reputation.</p>



<p>Furthermore, as outlined earlier, it’s quite apparent that Dogechain’s execution speed, paired with a practical and intuitive ecosystem, made $DOGE’s fortune in terms of popularity, with which this currency managed to distinguish itself over the multitude of other projects in the crypto space. Thus, its further success down the road will mostly depend on its adoption as money of exchange by way more merchants and stores than now, which will eventually drive more user adoption worldwide.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>It is undeniable that Dogecoin still holds great value and potential, needing further backing and support if this evolution witnesses even greater adoption. Support would involve not just an (excellent) community of fans (like Dogecoin’s community) and dedicated miners. Still, probably a determined team laying continuous updates to keep innovating, a more structural and organized plan, and the will that allows the project to stay on the crest of the wave in an ever-expanding and paradigm-breaking sector called the crypto space.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-litecoin"><strong>What is Litecoin?</strong></h3>



<p>Litecoin (LTC) is one of the most significant and major 2nd generation cryptocurrencies in the crypto universe.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Designed with the explicit intention of improving (and eventually surpassing) its own &#8220;father&#8221;&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/bitcoin-explained" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a>, this cryptocurrency is considered by many &#8220;the prince of altcoins&#8221; due to its lofty roots, supported by its history and birth as&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/bitcoin-forks-history" rel="noreferrer noopener">a fork of Bitcoin</a>. Moreover, it&#8217;s precisely these attributes that make this coin worthy of belonging to crypto&#8217;s nobility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Litecoin was born in the early days of October 2011, becoming the first altcoin officially. Conceived by the brilliant mind of Charles Lee &#8211; ex-Google employee and computer scientist &#8211; Lee was reportedly fascinated by cryptocurrencies since Bitcoin&#8217;s inception in 2009. He immediately perceived cryptocurrency&#8217;s dormant potential and, just as Bitcoin started receiving its first glimpses of notoriety &#8211; by starting circulating freely on the internet — he probed deeper and delved into the creation of a new cryptocurrency that would take inspiration on what he deemed the most important among Bitcoin&#8217;s positive features, while also implementing and improving on all the other aspects of the Orange Coin.</p>



<p>Litecoin is considered by many as Bitcoin&#8217;s closest &#8220;kin.&#8221;</p>



<h3 id="brief-history-of-litecoin"><strong>Brief History of Litecoin</strong></h3>



<p>The steps Lee traced for Litecoin&#8217;s launch were akin to the path undertaken by Bitcoin&#8217;s founder&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satoshi Nakamoto</a>&nbsp;before him: Litecoin was announced in 2011 on Bitcointalk, the same forum conceived and launched by Satoshi in conjunction with Bitcoin&#8217;s creation and later launch.</p>



<p>The response to Litecoin&#8217;s presentation on Bitcointalk was almost immediately a favorable one from the community, which at the time consisted mainly of computer scientists and developers that actively worked on the improvement of the blockchain&#8217;s technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As stated at the beginning of this article, Litecoin was the first distinct project sprouting from Bitcoin. The next digital currencies would come sometime after, their founders potentially tapping both the inspiration and boldness from Charles Lee&#8217;s first initiative. After Litecoin, Ripple was launched (in 2012), and &#8211; just two years after Litecoin&#8217;s onset- Ethereum made its appearance as well (in 2013).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Charles Lee — Litecoin&#8217;s Founder</p>



<p>Litecoin&#8217;s glorious path hasn&#8217;t stopped as years passed, and, in most recent times, the Litecoin Foundation formed several partnerships that increased the coin&#8217;s real trading/market-utility. Here are some of the recent milestones achieved by Litecoin&#8217;s team:</p>



<ul><li>2018 — partnerships with Wirex and UFC232</li><li>2019 — partnerships with Travala.com, Miami Dolphins and SafePal</li><li>2020-partnerships with NEXO and LiteBringer</li></ul>



<p>Given these historical facts and chronology, it wouldn&#8217;t be unfair to argue that Litecoin has probably strongly contributed to being the spark that initially ignited the primordial explosion, leading up to nowadays&#8217; constellation of tokens &amp; coins in the cryptocurrency universe. We could all agree that — while Bitcoin showed the way — the significant improvements, potential, and notoriety have become a modern reality via the creation of the subsequent altcoins. These, in turn, and as we know, led the charge towards the creation of a fully functional, unique, decentralized industry.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="litecoin-technology-and-advantages-nbsp"><strong>Litecoin Technology and Advantages&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Reflecting Lee&#8217;s philosophy, Litecoin&#8217;s foundational &#8220;dogmas&#8221; behind its design and inner workings are strictly tied to Bitcoin&#8217;s principles. Just as with BTC, the Litecoin network aims to allow lightning fast transactions with cheap transaction costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In analyzing the similarities between LTC and BTC, one shared feature (and probably the most important) is already quite apparent from the outline, and that is &#8220;The Halving.&#8221;</p>



<p>A moon-shaped, half-eclipsed Litecoin logo, created on the occasion of August 2019 Halving</p>



<p>Litecoin&#8217;s Halving, just like&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/bitcoin-halving-2020" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin&#8217;s Halving</a>, was devised to allow the autoregulation of the coin&#8217;s inflation by periodically:</p>



<ul><li>halving the block rewards for each mined block</li><li>reducing the number of newly mined/minted LTCs that is flowing into the market</li></ul>



<p>As with Bitcoin, Litecoin has a fixed total supply of 84.000.000 LTCs that&#8217;s been hard-coded into &#8220;its DNA.&#8221; Therefore, upon reaching that hard cap, the Litecoin network will stop minting new LTCs, potentially giving rise to the appreciation of the coin&#8217;s extrinsic value, as the remaining supply gets more and more scarce.</p>



<p>While the concept of Halving is a feature that draws fully from Bitcoin&#8217;s design, there is one aspect of divergence between LTC and BTC: the Litecoin network&#8217;s Halving does not increase the mining algorithm&#8217;s difficulty. This implies that&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-are-mining-pools" rel="noreferrer noopener">mining pools&#8217;</a>&nbsp;fees need not be reset after any Halving event occurs because — contrary to what happens in Bitcoin&#8217;s network &#8211; the constant mining algorithm difficulty does not imply higher structure and energy costs to adapt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another difference is related to Litecoin&#8217;s&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-blockchain" rel="noreferrer noopener">blockchain</a>&nbsp;and its inherent transactions, which are handled by an open-source platform that utilizes Scrypt in its&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/proof-of-stake-vs-proof-of-work" rel="noreferrer noopener">proof-of-work</a>&nbsp;mining algorithm, compared to Bitcoin&#8217;s SHA-256 hash function (more on this below).</p>



<h4 id="but-what-kind-of-improvements-did-litecoin-introduce-compared-to-bitcoin-nbsp"><strong>But what kind of improvements did Litecoin introduce, compared to Bitcoin?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Charles Lee focused on 3 main aspects when conceiving Litecoin:&nbsp;<strong>speed</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>security</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>quantity</strong>. Bitcoin had already been receiving its first parallel comparisons as &#8220;gold&#8217;s digital equivalent&#8221; — what Mr. Lee tried to achieve when conceiving Litecoin was to live up to similar expectations, trying to shape it as &#8220;silver&#8217;s digital equivalent.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A silvery rendered Litecoin&#8217;s coin</p>



<p>This is how he tackled these 3 key distinctive features:</p>



<p><strong>Speed</strong>. As hinted earlier in the article, the Litecoin network is built on a mining system known as Scrypt, which incorporates the same mining algorithm as Bitcoin (known as SHA-256) but also integrates more automated calculations and removes the progressively increasing difficulty of mining operations, despite requiring more performing mining rigs and machines.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Security</strong>. Security has been achieved with continuous updates, culminating with the most recent Litecoin Core v0.18.1 of June 2020. Recent updates aimed to reduce transaction costs by the scale of tens, at the same time adding a layer of security to the network, making it more efficient and streamlined than Bitcoin&#8217;s.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Quantity</strong>. Litecoin&#8217;s total supply is hard-capped at 84.000.000 LTCs — 4x more than Bitcoin&#8217;s total supply. This same design is what allows block-time to be ¼ of Bitcoin&#8217;s network block time. That is, new blocks on the Litecoin network are mined every 2 and ½ minutes.</p>



<p>These features potentially led up to the &#8220;Altcoins&#8217; Era&#8221; as we know it. The seed was planted for future altcoins (Ethereum above all) to see the possibility of improving Bitcoin&#8217;s foundational facets and adding functionalities and features that could be charged with real utility.</p>



<h4 id="is-it-all-bed-and-roses-are-the-advantages-so-clear-cut-compared-to-bitcoin-or-are-there-some-cons-to-the-above-design-nbsp"><strong>Is it all bed and roses? Are the advantages so clear-cut compared to Bitcoin? Or are there some cons to the above design?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>To answer, it&#8217;s important to better understand the Scrypt algorithm and the system on which the Litecoin network rests for its operability. It is an objective fact that the mining process is much simpler as a whole compared to Bitcoin&#8217;s.</p>



<p>But here comes both pros and cons. We&#8217;ve mentioned earlier that the machines needed to mine Litecoin need to be more powerful and more performing, favoring high-speed RAMs over CPU calculation power and establishing the prerequisite — for miners — to equip much more expensive systems, compared to Bitcoin&#8217;s mining rigs. This precondition, paired with the existing implementation of the LTC&#8217;s Scrypt system, guarantees network safety, significantly hoisting the network&#8217;s protection barriers against any modern web threats.</p>



<p>While this aspect well accomplishes to fulfill the desirable security features regarding Litecoin&#8217;s network, at the same time, it represents a disadvantage for miners. The higher cost structure related to the mining machines is coupled with lower profits for block-mining and transaction fees due to LTC&#8217;s lower pricing compared to Bitcoin&#8217;s and lower commission fees (almost 15 times lower).</p>



<p>Differently stated, this means that Litecoin&#8217;s network currently does not manage to incentivize mining in the same manner and just as effectively as Bitcoin Network due to the higher costs and unequaled, lower profits.</p>



<h3 id="perspective-and-takeaways-nbsp"><strong>Perspective and Takeaways&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Given Litecoin&#8217;s historic and modern pivotal role in the crypto sphere, it seems very likely that its value will gradually keep growing, reflecting the fact that LTC is still (and will likely be in the future as well) among the top ten cryptocurrencies per market cap.</p>



<p>Litecoin&#8217;s mean prices in the past years have been very stable (establishing themselves around the ~ 55$ dollar mark), implicitly stating its solid position in the crypto sector.</p>



<p>Despite its innate vocation for stability, LTC&#8217;s growth is probabilistically prone to continue, especially if looking at the mid-long term, also aided by the bull winds blowing over the whole alts market. On top of these considerations, LTC&#8217;s low total capitalization (~ 4,4 billion USD) versus its almost equal daily traded volume&#8217;s amount (~3.7 billion USD) marks this coin&#8217;s market as a very active one when compared to most altcoins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These statistics seem to highlight that investors and stakeholders&#8217; interest in LTC is very much alive, adding another piece of evidence that signals trust and growth potential for the coin in the future.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>Recently, Charles Lee&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/1340864115628130305?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>&nbsp;about the coin&#8217;s most palatable and valuable features.</p>



<p><em>Charles&#8217; Lee Tweet on December 21rst, 2020</em></p>



<p>Among the features listed by Lee:</p>



<p>&#8211; The high liquidity that supports trades on most exchanges.: aAs stated previously, LTC is indeed one of the oldest altcoins in circulation (since 2011), and this, in turn, guarantees that it&#8217;s listed on almost any exchange in the space.</p>



<p>&#8211; It&#8217;s the second-most&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/bitcoin-atm-guide" rel="noreferrer noopener">ATMs integrated cryptocurrency</a>&nbsp;in the world &#8211; obviously coming second after BTC &#8211; and this makes LTC even more liquid and tradeable.</p>



<p>&#8211; At launch,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/how-to-buy-bitcoin-with-paypal-complete-guide" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paypal opened the door to cryptocurrency</a>&nbsp;to more than 350,000,000 users throughout the world, and Litecoin is proudly in the batch of the four cryptocurrencies that have been included on Paypal&#8217;s cryptocurrency service. It&#8217;s not a stretch to say that Litecoin&#8217;s spike in value also benefited, rising from around the $65 mark to the actual $170, thus tripling its price.</p>



<p>&#8211; Grayscale Litecoin&#8217;s Trust (that is, Grayscale LTC&#8217;s Investment Fund) whose value had been assessed to be around $104,000,000 (and have soared thanks to the bull market peak).</p>



<p>&#8211; Fundamentals such as high-transaction volume (right now around daily transactions estimates report a bit more than 50,000 transactions per day) and no downtime in the last nine year.s, fFast and cheap transaction speed with a block-time around 2 minutes, and a transaction fee that ranges between 0,5-3 cents (making it 100 times cheaper than BTC&#8217;s).</p>



<p>Lee&#8217;s tweet could be considered the &#8220;exception that proves the rule,&#8221; though.: Litecoin does not often hit the headlines, at least not as often as the top two illustrious and more frequently featured cryptocurrencies. Yet, Litecoin will very likely hold its position as one of the most important coins in the panorama of the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/cryptocurrency-market-cap" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryptocurrency market</a>.</p>



<p>Despite its network being not as renowned as&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-ethereum-blockchain" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>&nbsp;or Bitcoin, LTC has had the merit of improving Bitcoin via the technical innovations introduced by its founder Charles Lee — and these, in turn, opened up the way to the cryptocurrency market as we know it today. Furthermore, Litecoin&#8217;s utility case is one of the closest (if not &#8220;the&#8221; closest) to possess the similar potential and practical application as Bitcoin, and it&#8217;s not to exclude that, thanks to all of LTC&#8217;s palatable features &#8211; among which we&#8217;ve identified security, speed and quantity — Litecoin will be playing a vital role as a store of value, becoming a fundamental means of exchange in the next future.</p>
