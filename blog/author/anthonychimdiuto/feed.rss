<h3 id="what-is-tezos-xtz"><strong>What is Tezos (XTZ)?</strong></h3>



<p>Arthur and Kathleen Breitman created the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/tezos-wallet" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tezos</a>&nbsp;blockchain in 2014 through Dynamic Ledger Solutions, a startup they founded to develop Tezos.</p>



<p>Some say that XTZ is somewhat similar to Ethereum because both blockchain networks feature smart contracts. Still, there are differences. Tezos boasts a far more advanced infrastructure. In other words, it doesn&#8217;t require a hard fork or changing the network&#8217;s protocol that makes previously invalid blocks and transactions valid for any upgrade. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum can&#8217;t offer the same to their users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Tezos team held an initial coin offering (ICO) in July 2017, raising the equivalent of $232 million (66,000 BTC and 361,000 ETH), the largest ICO. Following the ICO, the Tezos Foundation, based out of Switzerland, was created to launch the protocol.</p>



<p>The Tezos blockchain enables many features common to cryptocurrencies. Developers can use its software to run custom programming logic (smart contracts) and design new programs (decentralized applications) to replicate products and services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tezos can be described as secure, upgradable, and built-to-last. XTZ is an open-source platform that is said to ensure outstanding accuracy due to its smart contracts. Moreover, its staking process involves the community &#8211; people participate in governing the network by &#8220;baking.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Main Features of Tezos (XTZ) includes;</p>



<ul><li>Tezos is a self-amending decentralized platform for building dApps.</li><li>Network upgrade doesn&#8217;t require a hard fork, unlike other networks.</li><li>Tezos network confirmation is fast and cheap.</li><li>It can scale more transactions with smart contract enabled, unlike Ethereum.</li><li>&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3 id="tezos-xtz-price-chart"><strong>Tezos (XTZ) Price Chart:</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1348"  height="698"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-Chart.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34470"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-Chart.jpg 1348w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-Chart-989x512.jpg 989w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-Chart-300x155.jpg 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-Chart-768x398.jpg 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-Chart-380x197.jpg 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-Chart-800x414.jpg 800w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-Chart-1160x601.jpg 1160w"  sizes="(max-width: 1348px) 100vw, 1348px" ></figure>



<p>Making an XTZ price prediction may be difficult without assessing the token&#8217;s past performance. It helps to identify price fluctuation patterns and analyze which factors have the most significant influence. More so, Tezos news updates can affect the XTZ market movement and which will, in turn, affect the XTZ price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Tezos coin started its path with a scandal. It was launched in 2017. The ICO took place in July and was among the largest in terms of the accumulated investments. The price was average, and it was bouncing between $1.7 and slightly more than $2. Moreover, the company had to deal with a lawsuit over ICO. There were several of these lawsuits. The blame was on XTZ founders for selling unregistered assets.</p>



<p>This, of course, affected the token price. It only had started to increase and reached the $5 benchmark in December 2017, when another complaint was filed. As a result, it dropped down to $3.9 in a couple of days.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="595"  height="526"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-historical-data-2021.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34471"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-historical-data-2021.jpg 595w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-historical-data-2021-579x512.jpg 579w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-historical-data-2021-228x202.jpg 228w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-historical-data-2021-380x336.jpg 380w"  sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" ></figure>



<p>However, the collapse wasn&#8217;t disastrous. Tezos price regained its position pretty fast and exceeded the maximum price at the beginning of January 2018, reaching $5.75. No matter how promising it may have been, 2018 happened to be a complicated year for all cryptocurrencies, with constant ups and downs. As a result, XTZ ended the year at a Tezos price USD of $0.5.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What affected Tezos coin price significantly at the time was a set of regulations. Know Your Customer (KYC), and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements were introduced in summer 2018. This became a problem for XTZ as no user data was collected during the ICO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2019 after a long bearish period, Tezos value finally started to regain its value. Three-fourth of the year (from March to December) were relatively prosperous. However, all cryptocurrencies were increasing in price at the time. Tezos performed better than others. XTZ value was estimated to have risen 1,000% during the year. It climbed from 22nd position up to 10th in the cryptocurrency ranking by Coinmarketcap.</p>



<h3 id="market-prediction-for-tezos-xtz-price-2021"><strong>Market prediction for Tezos(XTZ) price 2021:</strong></h3>



<p>In 2017, the Tezos XTZ coin launch remained one of the most memorable Initial Coin Offering (ICO) to date. The scope of investment is twenty-four billion. Ever since then, the coin has been keeping a leading position in the market. For example, it&#8217;s considered one of the largest crypto, with a market capitalization of more than $2.5 billion as of late January 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The current market capitalization is $3.36 billion, while the Tezos current price trades at $4.49000 (6.87%) at the time of writing. XTZ is also the twenty-sixth largest crypto in the world by market capitalization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a total of 762,493,497 Circulating XTZ Supply and a market cap of $3,411,836,085.00 and a twenty-four-hour volume of $600,808,767.00</p>



<p>Nevertheless, it&#8217;s still early to rely on an optimistic XTZ price prediction alone. Traders are on guard because of the upcoming policy framework. Recently, the Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen said that cryptos could finance illicit activities, including terrorism. Nevertheless, she admitted that digital currencies could improve the efficiency of the financial system. This means that more regulations and policies are going to be introduced. As far as we know, they can both negatively and positively affect the price.</p>



<p>Now, let&#8217;s take a closer look at Tezos price predictions for 2021. As an overall observation, the estimations predict the XTZ coin price growth in 2021. But predictions differ in terms of scope and prediction firms.</p>



<h3 id="trading-beasts-tezos-coin-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Trading Beasts Tezos Coin Price Prediction 2021:</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="506"  height="1080"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Trading-Beasts-Tezos-Coin-Price-Prediction-2021-506x1080.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34472"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Trading-Beasts-Tezos-Coin-Price-Prediction-2021-506x1080.jpg 506w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Trading-Beasts-Tezos-Coin-Price-Prediction-2021-240x512.jpg 240w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Trading-Beasts-Tezos-Coin-Price-Prediction-2021-95x202.jpg 95w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Trading-Beasts-Tezos-Coin-Price-Prediction-2021-380x811.jpg 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Trading-Beasts-Tezos-Coin-Price-Prediction-2021.jpg 547w"  sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px" ></figure>



<p>TradingBeasts does justice to provide accurate price predictions for a wide range of digital coins like Tezos. They update their predictions daily, working with historical data and using a combination of linear and polynomial regressions to produce price predictions.</p>



<p>It should be noted that not everyone is optimistic about the price of a particular cryptocurrency. Trading Beasts, for example, projects a slight decrease for Tezos. According to the data provided, the price will revolve around $2.5 on average, as shown in the table above. The maximum possible, however, is $3.24.</p>

<p>Walletinvestor.com predicts future values with technical analysis for a wide selection of digital coins like Tezos. If you are looking for virtual currencies with good returns, XTZ can be a profitable investment option. Tezos price is $4.418 at the time of writing.</p>

<p>This price prediction firm is the most promising. It forecasts steady growth for Tezos coin price within the year. According to the website, at the end of the summer, it will cost $5.05, while in December &#8211; $11.68.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That is a 305% increase from the current XTZ coin price. Will this become true? Who knows. Regardless, don&#8217;t have your expectations up as most Tezos XTZ price predictions are much more reasonable.</p>

<p>Digital Coin Price has quite the same opinion about XTZ. It believes that the price will increase within a year, and investors should consider the token likely to be profitable. According to the XTZ price prediction, the Tezos price USD may be up to $4.52 in a year. It means that Tezos may double from the current value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Generally, Digital Coin Price is much more optimistic than Wallet Investor. It projects that the price will exceed $4 in February and finish the year with almost the exact figures<strong>.</strong></p>



<h3 id="tezos-coin-price-prediction-2021-nbsp"><strong>Tezos Coin Price Prediction 2021:</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In 2021, Tezos may heavily boost its price. We assume high predictable mass adoption of this cryptocurrency in months to come. We expect a Tezos rise with a strong capitalization and consequently a substantial value per coin increase.</p>



<p>As for 2022, Tezos is likely to continue in a bullish trend. Suppose the current trend of the crypto market growth will persist up to 2022. XTZ will also gain in value, at least in terms of the XTZ to fiat ratio. Potentially, it can even reach $4.89, according to Digital Coin Price. It will be the 2022 maximum that may take place in November.</p>



<p>Digital Coin Price also expects Tezos to enter a short period of recession. According to the prediction, the price will fluctuate. It may reach the overall maximum in August &#8211; $7.14</p>



<h3 id="tezos-coin-price-prediction-2025"><strong>Tezos Coin Price Prediction 2025:</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="620"  height="972"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-Coin-Price-Prediction-2025.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34477"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-Coin-Price-Prediction-2025.jpg 620w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-Coin-Price-Prediction-2025-327x512.jpg 327w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-Coin-Price-Prediction-2025-129x202.jpg 129w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-Coin-Price-Prediction-2025-380x596.jpg 380w"  sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" ></figure>



<p>The next few years are likely to be prosperous for the XTZ coin. Once again, if we are to rely on the current trends of increasing crypto adoption, as a strong altcoin, Tezos is going to bloom. We have decided to break up the long-term XTZ price prediction by year.</p>



<p>In 2021 and 2022, Tezos is highly unlikely to be in a bearish movement.</p>



<p>2023 is a controversial year in terms of predictions. For example, Trading Beasts predicts a drop in prices in the middle of the year—down to $2.15 in June, to be precise. Later, however, the Tezos coin might regain its position and return to the $3 benchmark in December 2023. Generally, such volatility is quite average for Tezos.</p>



<p>2024 is supposed to be a much better year for Tezos. Both Trading Beasts and Digital Coin Price expect the coin to rise. Trading Beasts forecasts a gradual increase: XTZ will finish the year with a value of almost $4 on average.</p>



<p>2025 is going to be even better. That&#8217;s the year when the token is supposed to hit $10, according to Digital Coin Price. However, it won&#8217;t manage to secure too high of a price. The analysts expect that XTZ will drop down to $8 each time it reaches $9-$10.</p>



<h3 id="tezos-coin-xtz-price-prediction-verdict-nbsp"><strong>Tezos coin (XTZ) Price Prediction Verdict:&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>It&#8217;s still hard to estimate the Tezos worth after ten years from now. Yet, one thing is clear: if the token remains on the market in 2030, it will have passed the test and will manage to mature. It means that it will have a reliable time-honored infrastructure and a pool of devoted users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t far-fetched, considering that XTZ developers are constantly improving the technical backup and promoting the token on the market. Therefore, it&#8217;s likely that the token will reach its overall maximum.</p>



<p>Although Tezos has already gained a significant position in the crypto market, it has already been criticized. Predominantly, of course, the critics focused on the lawsuits. Some community experts also don&#8217;t approve of the governance philosophy. In particular, Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum founder, often disagreed with the implemented policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nonetheless, experts can&#8217;t deny the benefits of the token and the technology behind it. Even Buterin admitted that it was a &#8220;well-thought-out&#8221; tech and hoped it would do well. Such a positive market sentiment is a reason to believe in an optimistic Tezos price prediction.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-cosmos-atom"><strong>WHAT IS COSMOS (ATOM)?</strong></h3>



<p>Joe Kwon founded&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/cosmos-wallet" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmos</a>&nbsp;cryptocurrency. He was a former programmer at Amazon. Joe Kwon worked with Ethan Buchman to build the Cosmos (Atom). Ethan Buchman aims to provide the community with various options for engaging in consensus-building across a wide range of industries. At the same time, Jae Kwon is the creator of the Tendermint protocol. He is passionate about promoting the Tendermint consensus algorithm, which he positions as the most efficient consensus algorithm that seeks maximum speed and scalability.</p>



<p>Together they created Tendermint in 2017, which was created to replace proof-of-work as the consensus algorithm for blockchains, which eventually turned into a company, birthing Cosmos(Atom), in march 2019, an initial coin offering (ICO). They managed to raise $17 million in less than 30 minutes of the ICO, and one ATOM was sold for $0.1</p>



<p>The Cosmos (Atom) goal is to create an &#8216;internet of blockchains&#8217; that resolves both scalability and interoperability issues in the blockchain. The Cosmos network can interact with other cryptocurrencies and applications, which other blockchain networks cannot achieve.</p>

<p>Cosmos (ATOM) is significantly new on the market, so many people still may not understand too much about it. It poses a complex cryptocurrency project to comprehend. Still, a vital thing to remember is that Cosmos essentially solves the scalability and interoperability problems that blockchains face today as it sits amongst the top-ranked projects.</p>



<p>Following the listing in march 2019, the Cosmos price USD started trading on exchanges with a price of $3.40 and quickly reached $5. The cryptocurrency went on to surge from April through to June as it rocketed by a total of 132% to reach the then ATH price of around $7.23 in June 2019. However, after reaching this level of resistance, ATOM rolled over and dropped by a significant 72% as it plummeted into support found in September at $1.95.</p>



<p>Many expected the price after listing at $0.4 – $0.5. However, at the peak, the cost reached $8 (80x of the ICO price). In May 2019, the Cosmos coin was added by TrustWallet. This action immediately caused the rise of the rate to $5.</p>



<p>Cosmos quickly reached an all-time high of $25.15 11 days ago. Cosmos is trading on 82 exchanges, with the top exchanges being Bitforex ($458.62M), Binance ($249.61M), and ZG.com ($233.91M).

<p>Furthermore, Cosmos price predictions are presently bullish, though in a bear zone currently, which is a reasonable buy price, purchasing Atom at its current $17.65. Tezos coin value sometimes increases when the Tezos current news at that time positively affects its market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Atom Coin price prediction for 2025 by most professional prediction platforms is pegged around $98. The majority predicts that if the decentralized finance (Defi) space expands into offering new types of products, the Atom coin price can triple with the Defi ecosystem&#8217;s adoption. As such, the Atom Coin price prediction by 2025-2030 is that its value has a higher possibility of surpassing its previous all-time high if the Defi space keeps expanding at this rate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, the Atom price prediction by 2025-2030 is that its value has a higher possibility of surpassing its previous all-time high. Meanwhile, a recent survey confirms that over 100 million persons are now into crypto. This will boost the Defi market capitalization by over $80 billion, according to Coingecko. More adoption and increased market capitalization will positively affect the Atom coin value.</p>

<p>Having a final verdict for the Cosmos (Atom) price prediction is impossible due to the uncertainties associated with the crypto market. Cosmos is one of the crypto coins on the Grayscale portfolios, a top cryptocurrency investment platform headed by Michael Sonnenshein.</p>



<p>Grayscale Investments, the world&#8217;s largest digital asset manager, has filed to register five new trusts for cryptocurrency assets, including ATOM and several connected to the decentralized finance (Defi) space.</p>



<p>Grayscale Cosmos Trust is solely and passively invested in Atom, enabling investors to gain exposure to Atom in the form of security while avoiding the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping Atom directly.</p>



<p>As with other trusts filed previously, the registrations were made by Delaware Trust Company on January 22nd, 2021, which is Grayscale&#8217;s statutory trustee for the US state.</p>



<p>However, the filings do not mean that trusts will necessarily be launched for the four new assets but do indicate that the asset manager is laying the groundwork for potential launching.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-litecoin-ltc"><strong>What is Litecoin (LTC)?</strong></h3>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/litecoin-wallet" rel="noreferrer noopener">Litecoin Cryptocurrency</a>&nbsp;was created by Charlie Lee, a former worker at Google, in October 2011. Since 2011, the crypto coin has consistently been among the top 10 largest capitalizations in the cryptocurrency market. Litecoin is one of the very first altcoins in the market. A fork of Bitcoin blockchain network.</p>



<p>Litecoin has almost the same features as Bitcoin except in a few areas where there are unique and significant features. The cryptocurrency was created to solve the Bitcoin shortfalls and, most times acts as a test environment for the Bitcoin blockchain. These top features of Litecoin include:</p>



<ul><li>A &#8220;proof of work&#8221; that uses the Scrypt hash.</li><li>Four times faster block creation with an average interval of 2.5 minutes.</li><li>The total number of units is 84 million.</li><li>A mining difficulty that changes every two and a half days.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>These features made it a top alternative to the Bitcoin network. In what many experts refer to the &#8220;digital silver,&#8221; where bitcoin is the digital gold.</p>



<h3 id="litecoin-price-chart-nbsp"><strong>Litecoin Price Chart:&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Litecoin-Price-Chart.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-32540" ></figure>



<p>Litecoin Price started trading around $4.4 at launch in 2011 and quickly reached $30. The all-time low was recorded at $1.11 on January 24, 2015. Since then, Litecoin Price has incredibly increased, appreciating over 3000% since its launch until date.</p>



<p>Following the launch on October 7, 2011. The project was then listed on different cryptocurrency exchanges available. The first significant increase in the Litecoin Price was in 2011 after reaching $30 following launch. The Litecoin price quickly dropped to $5 on November 8, 2013. After ten days, the price increased to approximately $50 due to hype around Litecoin coin price on Litecoin news updates at this time.</p>



<p>However, in late 2017, the price made a new all-time high at $70 and then jumped to the Litecoin all-time high of $400. This was recorded by year&#8217;s end in the overall 2017 bull run. The majority of the Litecoin news headlines at this time also contributed to the hype built around the Litecoin coin price. After the bull runs in 2017, the digital assets have fallen hard down to below $100. But in late 2020, the Litecoin value recorded a price drop, and later at this period, the Litecoin value went back up again. Though it&#8217;s yet to set a new all-time high at the recent 2021 bull market, it trades at the Litecoin current price of $144 below its all-time high in 2020.</p>



<p>The current market capitalization is $9.5 billion, while the Litecoin current price trades at $144 at the time of writing. LTC is also currently the eighth largest crypto in the world by market capitalization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Litecoin current price at the time of writing is not up to half its previous all-time high (ATH). The Litecoin price USD target for most predictions in 2021 ranges around $142 and $198. We might see a price half of the previous ATH above the Litecoin current price before the end of the year.</p>



<h3 id="market-prediction-for-litecoin-ltc-price-2021"><strong>Market prediction for Litecoin (LTC) price 2021:</strong></h3>



<p>Litecoin predictions are currently tricky. However, many experts predicted a new all-time high above its previous highest all-time high of $375.29 on December 19, 2017. There are still Litecoin predictions with facts that the Litecoin value will record a new all-time high above its previous ATH.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s look at these publications and statements from eminent personalities featured across popular top Litecoin news channels on the Litecoin predictions:</p>



<h4 id="trading-beasts-litecoin-price-prediction-2021"><strong><em>Trading Beasts Litecoin Price Prediction 2021:</em></strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Trading-Beasts-Litecoin-Price-Prediction-2021.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-32551" ></figure>



<p>Trading Beasts releases monthly predictions of different crypto assets based on &#8220;historical data and using a combination of linear and polynomial regressions.&#8221; As a result, the platform has Litecoin price predictions up until 2024.</p>



<p>Per the Litecoin predictions, the minimum LTC price drop will be in February 2020 at $97.544, while the maximum Litecoin price USD increase will stand at $143.448. The analysis shows a -20% decrease in price at the minimum Litecoin coin price drop in February. The Trading Beats group is more optimistic about the Litecoin coin price increase in the long run. The maximum price prediction for the year-end is $168.157. The analysis is that the LTC price will drop to a Litecoin price of USD 97.5, averaging at $144 for most of 2021, before hitting a potential $168.157 in December 2021. This is around a 15% increase of Litecoin&#8217;s current price at the time of writing.</p>



<p>The group claims that the if price stays strong at $168 in Dec 2021. It will potentially hit $217 by the end of 2022 and will keep increasing to a potential price of $268 until 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="wallet-investor-litecoin-price-prediction-2021"><strong><em>Wallet Investor Litecoin Price Prediction 2021:</em></strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Wallet-Investor-Litecoin-Price-Prediction-2021.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-32562" ></figure>



<p>The team at crypto prediction portal Wallet Investor is pessimistic that the Litecoin price USD value will drop to around $61.736 sometime during 2021. This projection is based mostly on LTC price performance over 2019 — a period after the 2017 bull run during which Litecoin recorded the lowest low since 2017. Meanwhile, many of the conditions like usage and circulating supply surrounding the possibility of such a decrease in Litecoin price is still unfeasible.</p>



<p>At this Litecoin current price, such a decrease will be over 50% in the Litecoin value now.</p>



<h4 id="the-long-forecast-litecoin-price-prediction-report"><strong><em>The Long Forecast Litecoin Price Prediction Report:</em></strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Long-Forecast-Litecoin-Price-Prediction.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-32573" ></figure>



<p>This is a top research group that publishes analytics about various cryptocurrencies. They are quite optimistic that Litecoin&#8217;s future is bright. The group expects Litecoin price to close at $218 by May 2021 and a record high of $232 by Nov 2021. In the long run, the group expects the price to hit $1,216 in 2025.</p>



<h4 id="cointelegraph-markets-litecoin-price-prediction"><strong><em>Cointelegraph Markets Litecoin Price Prediction:</em></strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Cointelegraph-Markets-Litecoin-Price-Prediction-1080x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-32584" ></figure>



<p>Cointelegraph Markets linked the LTC price movement to the Silver price movement. The analysis was done with Silver in correlation with Bitcoin and Litecoin price action. They suggest that a Silver Price increase will determine how much Litecoin Price will increase.</p>



<p>&#8220;The data suggest that silver returns may work as a predictor for future Litecoin returns. From the model employed, if Silver&#8217;s return rose by 1% yesterday, we can expect that Litecoin returns may decrease by -0.232% today.&#8221;</p>



<p>So, while the silver price appreciates during the year, the Litecoin price will continue to decrease in return. So, a decrease in Silver Price can trigger an increase in return for the Litecoin price USD value.</p>



<h4 id="digital-coin-price-prediction-for-litecoin-price-prediction-nbsp-nbsp"><strong><em>Digital Coin Price Prediction for Litecoin Price Prediction:&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Digital-Coin-Price-Prediction-for-Litecoin.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-32595" ></figure>



<p>Digital Coin Price, a platform that makes its predictions based on historical data, also has an optimistic look at the future market price of Litecoin.</p>



<p>The platform predicts that Litecoin Price should keep at an uptrend throughout the year. The platform expects the minimum low at around $90, while the maximum high for the year will hang around $195.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="litecoin-price-prediction-2021-nbsp"><strong>Litecoin Price Prediction 2021:</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The market price of Litecoin can reach $200 before the end of March.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many factors can drive the price up during this period. The digital asset is Silver to bitcoin in comparison. The blockchain technology of the digital coin is a direct upgrade of what bitcoin currently serves. The full potential is yet to be fully reached in terms of price. There is already an on-going wide adoption across the world, mostly in Asia and Africa.</p>



<p>In correlation to its counterpart Bitcoin, there is a huge potential for price increase in the future and now. Most importantly, the price, for now, can still get to $200 before year-end. However, most experts predict an insane price increase starting around 2023 &#8211; 2025. During this time, the price can get to over $1000.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another competitive advantage here is the integration of privacy protocol on Litecoin Transactions. The MimbleWimble Protocol is a protocol that will enable private Litecoin transactions. Incognito wallet users will be able to send and receive LTC tokens without third parties&#8217; ability to surveil funds. This feature creates an edge for Litecoin, among other privacy coins.</p>



<h3 id="litecoin-price-prediction-2025-nbsp"><strong>Litecoin price prediction 2025:</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The third halving for Litecoin is set to take place in 2023. This is a POW token, and it&#8217;s created based on mining rewards. In doing so, block rewards would be halved to 6.25 LTC. This will reduce the halving reward for miners though bringing the ever-total supply to exist forever closer. Hence the closer it gets, the scarcer the supply becomes, and the price will relatively increase in value. On a usual occasion, the Litecoin halving event shoots the price of LTC up just like its counterpart Bitcoin.</p>



<p>As such, the Litecoin price prediction by 2025-2030 is that its value has a higher possibility of surpassing its previous all-time high if it doesn&#8217;t happen before the halving date in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="litecoin-ltc-price-prediction-verdict-nbsp"><strong>Litecoin (LTC) Price Prediction Verdict:&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Having a final verdict for the Litecoin price prediction is impossible due to the uncertainties in the market. Litecoin is one of the crypto coins on the Grayscale portfolios, a top cryptocurrency investment platform headed by Michael Sonnenshein.</p>



<p>&#8220;Grayscale Litecoin Trust is solely and passively invested in Litecoin, enabling investors to gain exposure to LTC in the form of a security while avoiding the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping LTC directly.&#8221;</p>



<p>Moreover, this digital Silver serves as the best and better alternative to bitcoin, most especially in tech, enabling fast and cheap transactions for users. It&#8217;s usually referred to as the Silver of digital assets.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Grayscale-Litecoin-Price-Prediction-1326x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-32606" ></figure>



<p>Grayscale investing in Litecoin is a verdict to investors on the potentials of the cryptocurrency in the future. You can easily buy this crypto as an investor using Atomic Wallet, the best non-custodial mobile wallets in the crypto space with 500+ coins aside LTC, available on the wallet. Litecoin can also be exchanged for another crypto using Atomic Wallet.</p>



<p>Another major factor is the partnership with Ternio to launch the Litecoin Card. This card will allow users to load it with Litecoin and spend it at any of its over 50 million merchants worldwide.</p>



<h3 id="how-to-buy-litecoin-ltc"><strong>How to buy Litecoin (LTC)?</strong></h3>

<h3 id="what-is-binance-coin-bnb"><strong>What is Binance Coin (BNB)?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Binance Coin</strong><a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/binance-coin-price" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Cryptocurrency</a>&nbsp;was initially created on Ethereum as an ERC20 token before launching its two parallel chains, Binance chain and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Binance.com, founded by Chanpeng Zhao (aka CZ) and Roger Wang in 2017. He is a former team member at OKCoin Exchange as the CTO in 2014. Binance Coin is the best exchange token amongst its peers in the crypto market.</p>



<p>Binance Coin majorly started as an exchange token for receiving discounts in fees on Binance trading platforms. It can also be used across grocery stores for merchants who accept BNB for payment. The token allows its holders to participate in Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) done on Binance.com. Binance Coin later launched its blockchain, the Binance Chain, in April 2019. Its primary focus is to facilitate fast, decentralized (or non-custodial) trading.</p>



<p>Later in 2020, Binance launched the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The mainnet took off in September 2020, since it was announced in April 2020. BSC is the parallel blockchain to Binance Chain that will enable smart contracts and the staking mechanism for BNB. BSC allows the creation of smart contract tokens (Bep20) on BSC. There are numerous other features of Binance Coin, which include:</p>



<ul><li>Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility for developers.</li><li>A high-speed smart contract enabled blockchain for fast transactions on smart contract calls.&nbsp;</li><li>The fee charges on Binance smart chain are minimal against its competitor, Ethereum.&nbsp;</li><li>Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus mechanism.</li></ul>



<p>These features made it a top alternative to the Ethereum network. In what many experts refer to the blockchain for all. This is because the Ethereum blockchain charges high fees for smart contract executions, majorly on Automated Market Maker Protocols, making it a platform for those &#8220;who can afford the fees.&#8221; But BSC, which is EVM compatible, charges minimal fees for the same smart contract execution, making a platform for &#8220;all types of traders.&#8221;</p>



<h3 id="binance-coin-price-chart-nbsp"><strong>Binance Coin Price Chart:&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Binance-Coin-Price-Chart.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33074" ></figure>



<p>Binance coin entered the market on July 25, 2017, with the trading price above the price at Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Later on, the price started to improve and reached $3 at the end of August. With specific market effects, BNB ended 2017 with a trading price of $8.</p>



<p>Since its launch in 2017, the Binance coin has performed well, serving as an exchange discount and service token. The first significant increase in the Binance Coin Price was in 2017 after listing.</p>



<p>Binance first listed BNB for trading on July 14, 2017, and the token has achieved a nearly 9,600 percent return on investment from its December 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) price of $0.10.</p>



<p>The Binance Coin, coin price in January 2018 opened on level ground at $23.25, which is the highest price the coin reached until 2020. This was a fantastic phase for Binance investors around the crypto world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Feb 2018, most of the coins recorded a big decline in price in what experts called the bear market trend. The table turned down the Binance coin. The price declined below $6.12 in early February 2020. This was more like a discount to investors considering the current price of one BNB.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But later, in late June 2018, the BNB coin price increased up to 200%. Binance coin price continued to shine in late June 2018 with $16.71 per one. Calculating its performance to other exchange tokens, you will realize that it was a good investment for most investors who bought.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>In February 2021, Binance Coin reached a new all-time high, double the previous all-time high in 2018 and 2019. For those who suffered in the 2018 bear market, 2021 is your year of golden opportunity. The Binance coin&#8217;s current price is already on popular Binance Coin news channels.</p>



<p>The current market capitalization is $9.10 billion, while the Binance Coin&#8217;s current price trades at $59.01 at writing. BNB is also currently the ninth-largest crypto in the world by market capitalization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Binance Coin&#8217;s current price at the time of writing is above its previous all-time high (ATH). It recorded a new all-time high this February at $59.37, according to Coinmarketcap data. The Binance Coin price USD target for most predictions in 2021 ranges around $70 &#8211; $100. We might see a price half of the previous ATH above the Binance Coin current price before the end of the year.</p>



<p><strong>Market prediction for Binance Coin (BNB) price 2021:</strong></p>



<p>Binance coin predictions currently don&#8217;t seem to be a difficult prediction. Based on fundamentals, the crypto coin will increase more in the coming years. While many experts believe it will grow on value. Some others claim that it will be based on the adoption of BSC, while others claim that Ethereum will combat the new issues it&#8217;s facing regarding high fees to retain its top position. The current ATH now remains $59.37/BNB.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, let&#8217;s look at these publications and statements from eminent personalities featured across popular top Binance Coin news channels on the Binance Coin predictions:</p>



<p><strong><em>Trading Beasts Binance Coin Price Prediction 2021:</em></strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trading-Beasts-Binance-Coin-Price-Prediction-2021.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33085" ></figure>



<p>Trading Beasts releases monthly predictions of different cryptocurrencies based on &#8220;historical data and using a combination of linear and polynomial regressions.&#8221; The platform is optimistic about Binance Coin price and has Binance Coin price predictions up until 2024.</p>



<p>Per the Binance Coin predictions, there won&#8217;t be a price drop throughout the year. The predictions confirm that there will be a consistent price increase for BNB price 11throughout the year. The maximum Binance coin USD increase will be at $62.862 by the end of the year. The analysis shows a +20% increase in price at the maximum Binance coin price in March. The Trading Beats group is more optimistic about the Binance coin price increase in the long run. The analysis is that the BNB price will make a maximum price increase around $60 &#8211; $69 throughout the year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The complete analysis by the group is focused on a steady price increase. In the analysis, there will never be a drop in price in a month-on-month average price.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Wallet Investor Binance Coin Price Prediction 2021:</em></strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Wallet-Investor-Binance-Coin-Price-Prediction-2021.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33096" ></figure>



<p>Wallet Invest, a crypto prediction portal, is also bullish on Binance Coin Price USD value in 2021. Wallet Investor predicts the maximum Binance Coin Price USD value to hang above $70 &#8211; $81.77 in 2021. This projection is based largely on BNB price performance over the previous years. In the previous years, the growth rate of BNB has been ending on a new price better than the previous year. Meanwhile, many of the conditions like more use cases and the recent parallel Binance chain called BSC have heavily contributed to increased Binance token price.</p>



<p>At this Binance Coin current price, such an increase will be over 10% in the Binance Coin value now.</p>

<p>The only odd Binance Coin Price prediction is from Cryptoground. It predicts that BNB might fall to $5.80 by the end of 2021. The only odd prediction so far. The crypto assets price analysis and forecast platform even added their version of BNB price prediction 2024, where they stated that BNB might reach $28.8 by 2024.</p>



<p><strong><em>Gov.Capital Binance Coin Price Prediction:</em></strong></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img  loading="lazy"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Digital-Coin-Price-Prediction-for-Binance-Coin-Price-Prediction-1-626x1080.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33140"  width="269"  height="463" ></figure>



<p>Digital Coin Price, a platform that makes its predictions based on historical data and performance alongside fundamental reasons, also has an optimistic look at the future market price of Binance Coin.</p>



<p>Just like Trading beasts, they predict that Binance Coin Price should keep at an uptrend throughout the year. The platform expects the minimum low at around $79.96 throughout the year, excluding this month. Simultaneously, the maximum high for the year will hang around $99.94 in February and $98.84 in September.</p>



<p><strong>Binance Coin Price Prediction 2021:</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The market price of Binance Coin can easily reach $200 before the year ends. There are numerous strong factors to this, and we will discuss them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many factors can drive the price up during this period. The digital asset is a big competitor to Ethereum, specifically the Binance Smart Chain. The blockchain technology of the digital coin is a direct upgrade of what Ethereum currently serves. The full potential is yet to be fully reached in terms of a price considering the current price of its competitor Ethereum. Currently, the Binance Smart Chain is already eating up the big volume on Ethereum transaction count.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In correlation to its counterpart Ethereum, there is a huge potential for a price increase in the future. The price now it&#8217;s still under-valued because it now serves as the best alternative to the dilemma faced by Ethereum network users and developers. The dilemma of gas fees and periodic network congestion. However, the price is gauging to stop at around $100 before the year ends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another top competitive advantage is its user-friendly and the security it offers. The network runs a Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus mechanism. This allows the network to easily freeze funds, protecting the network from rug pull projects looking to spam the ecosystem with scam projects.</p>



<p><strong>Binance Coin price prediction 2025:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Ethereum Blockchain first spearheaded the Defi adoption. Binance Smart Chain was launched last year during the Defi frenzy to compete with the Ethereum blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The BSC ecosystem is EVM compatible, making it Ethereum developers easier to build on the Binance smart chain. Many more projects now have ported through to Binance smart chain to bring low fees to its users while offering the same services it offers to its users on the Ethereum blockchain to BSC now.</p>



<p>In the long run, Binance Coin Price will be at a value near that of Ethereum currently. BNB Price at $1000 is possible by 2025 if the Defi adoption grows bigger.</p>



<p><strong>Binance Coin (BNB) Price Prediction Verdict:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Having a final verdict for the Binance Coin price prediction is impossible due to the uncertainties in the market. Binance coin is currently among ten cryptocurrencies, according to Coinmarketcap data. Binance coin is the best performing exchange token in the crypto market.</p>



<p>Being the best alternative to Ethereum places a good validation on Binance coin in the long run. Binance Smart Chain offers smart contract services alongside every other use case deployable on the Ethereum network. It offers even more with its parallel chain Binance Chain.</p>



<p>Advantages and benefits are abounding here. For investors on Ethereum, there is usually a loss of funds that are most times unrecoverable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Funds recovery on Ethereum is usually impossible. But the PoA consensus mechanism of the Binance Smart Chain makes funds recovery possible to some extent. This boosts investors&#8217; confidence and adds some credibility.</p>



<p>These factors post some kind of verdict to investors on the potentials of the cryptocurrency in the future. You can easily buy this crypto as an investor using Atomic Wallet, the best non-custodial mobile wallets in the crypto space with 500+ coins aside from BNB available on the wallet. Binance Coin can also be exchanged for another crypto using Atomic Wallet.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/unus-sed-leo-complete-guide-1920x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34322" ></figure>



<p>In this guide, we will explain the &#8216;UNUS SED LEO&#8217; Coin. The name is a Latin word that means &#8216;one, but a lion&#8217;.</p>



<h3 id="what-is-unus-sed-leo-leo-coin-nbsp"><strong>What is UNUS SED LEO (LEO) Coin?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>UNUS SED LEO (LEO) is a utility token created for use across the iFinex ecosystem. The strange name is based on a Latin citation from one of Aesop&#8217;s fables.</p>



<p>The utility token allows Bitfinex users to get a discount on trading fees. The percentage in discount over trading fees depends on the amount of LEO that the customer has in their account.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="brief-history-of-unus-sed-leo"><strong>Brief History of Unus Sed Leo</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/unus-sed-leo-history-1920x668.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34323" ></figure>



<p>The utility coin was launched in the year 2019. The white paper was released in May 2019 by the&nbsp;<em>Unus Sed Leo Limited,</em>&nbsp;a British Virgin Islands company limited by shares, formed for the purpose of issuing LEO coins. Unus Sed Leo Limited is a subsidiary of iFinex. LEO tokens serve as the ecosystem utility token for their products pioneered by Bitfinex, a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-cryptocurrency" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryptocurrency</a>&nbsp;trading platform owned by iFinex company.</p>



<p>The coin was issued through an Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) from May 2019 till May 13, 2019. It was reported that&nbsp;<em>Capital Corporation,</em>&nbsp;a payment processor said to be holding funds from other exchanges including&nbsp;<em>QuadrigaCX</em>, (the company that processed the iFinex payments) saw part of its funds held by the government in an alleged illegal transmission between Tether Inc and Bitfinex trading platform.</p>



<p><em>Bitfinex</em>, the debut exchange where LEO was popularly used, is the subsidiary of&nbsp;<em>iFinex</em>. iFinex warned that it may not be possible to recover the funds lost in its case with the government. To cover the financial shortfall, it decided to launch the LEO token and sell through IEO to raise $1 billion, where each LEO token was pegged to 1&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/academy/what-are-stable-coins-2" rel="noreferrer noopener">USDT</a>&nbsp;for the 1 billion supply during the fundraise.</p>



<p>After the hack in 2016, Bitfinex reportedly covered the loss from the hack through its sister firm,&nbsp;<em>Tether Inc</em>, where $850 million was reportedly taken from Tether reserve. The New York government said it was an illegal transfer, which must be averted. iFinex resolved to launch UNUS SED LEO (LEO) tokens on&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-ethereum-blockchain" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum Blockchain</a>&nbsp;and EOS Blockchain in order to avert the alleged illegal transfer. Whereas tokens are launched on a single blockchain, LEO was introduced on two blockchains where 64% seats on Ethereum and 36% on EOS. In an IEO, iFinex successfully raised $1 billion dollars from investors, which will be compensated back through token burn and buy back at the market rate from 27% of the iFinex net profit every month.</p>



<p>To maintain investors&#8217; confidence, a dedicated dashboard was created to break down in full details the token &#8216;buyback and burn&#8217; process together with the current circulating supply available in real-time. The first phase of the burn mechanism only included revenue from trading fees. In the coming phase, the revenues from other products of iFinex will be used. The buyback and burn will continue until 100% of the 1 billion LEO tokens get burned. In the future, there will no longer be a LEO token after 100% buyback and burn.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="unus-led-technology"><strong>UNUS LED Technology</strong></h3>



<p>UNUS LED technology is based on two blockchains, which are&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-ethereum-blockchain" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/eos-coin-guide" rel="noreferrer noopener">EOS</a>&nbsp;Blockchain, at 64% and 36%, respectively.</p>



<h3 id="features-of-leo-token"><strong>Features of LEO Token</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/unus-sed-leo-takeaways-1920x668.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34324" ></figure>



<p>The main feature of the LEO token is that it will not last forever. The token is based on a buyback and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/token-burning-atomic-wallet-guide" rel="noreferrer noopener">burn mechanism</a>&nbsp;where all initial and maximum supply will be bought back and burned by the iFinex company using some percentage of the company&#8217;s net profit. Other features included;</p>



<h4 id="discount-and-marketplace-token-nbsp">Discount and Marketplace Token:&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The utility token majorly serves as a discount token for the Bitfinex trading platform. It is used to offer discounts on fees charged on main accounts and sub-accounts, including deposits and withdrawals. These discounts vary based on an account holder&#8217;s user status level, the amount of UNUS SED LEO held in an account over the previous month, and the type of trade done on the Bitfinex platform.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="marketplace-token-for-all-ifinex-products">Marketplace Token for all iFinex products:</h4>



<p>Aside from being a discount token for the Bitfinex trading platform, it also serves as the marketplace token for all iFinex products. Token holders on the platform can use the utility token to access other numerous products available on the iFinex.</p>



<h4 id="dual-blockchain-nbsp">Dual Blockchain:&nbsp;</h4>



<p>It exists on double blockchain platforms. These two blockchain platforms include Ethereum and EOS blockchains. This means that you can send the coin as an EOS token or Ethereum token any day. On Ethereum, it&#8217;s 64% of the token that exists there, while on EOS, it&#8217;s 34% of the token supply that exists on it.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="smart-contract-compatible">Smart Contract Compatible:</h4>



<p>Both blockchains have smart contracts enabled on them. The dual chain feature of the coin with smart contracts enabled on them allows developers to build DApps (<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-are-dapps" rel="noreferrer noopener">Decentralized Applications</a>) and implement the token into DApps for various use cases available on both chains. This feature aids&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/smart-contracts" rel="noreferrer noopener">smart contract</a>&nbsp;inter-chain capabilities built by developers and readily available on both chains.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="ecosystem-agnostic-nbsp"><em>Ecosystem Agnostic:</em>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The token is agnostic. In an AMA with Bitfinex organized by Atomic Wallet, Bitfinex highlights that it will add a protocol onto the token to create distributive data streams and distributed marketplaces. This idea will make the token the backbone of its social platform (Bitfinex Pulse) and market distribution plan. Being the backbone of Bitfinex Pulse, a social platform and news aggregator platform for traders makes it compatible with the social platform.</p>



<h3 id="advantages-of-leo-coins"><strong>Advantages of LEO Coins</strong></h3>



<p>Let&#8217;s look at the possible advantages of this unique token.</p>



<h4 id="the-leo-coin-serves-as-the-exchange-token-on-bitfinex-nbsp">The LEO coin serves as the exchange token on Bitfinex:&nbsp;</h4>



<p>It supports the reduction of taker and lending fees on the Bitfinex trading platform. LEO holders are also entitled to a 25% crypto withdrawal and deposit fee discounts. In other words, Bitfinex will allow any user on the platform holding more than 50 million LEO to withdraw USD 2 million without incurring additional fees.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="discount-on-other-ifinex-products-nbsp">Discount on other iFinex Products:&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Any other products and services offered by the iFinex company, which is the parent company, will get a discounted price for any user holding LEO tokens per details.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="fast-transactions-nbsp">Fast Transactions:&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The EOS Blockchain offers a faster transaction of crypto-assets built on it compared to Ethereum. The transaction on EOS is nearly instant. While Ethereum is also fast, EOS is faster.</p>



<h4 id="available-on-double-blockchains-nbsp">Available on Double Blockchains:&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The availability of the tokens on two blockchains makes it possible for investors to enjoy the benefits attached to both chains when sending or receiving the Tokens. It also attracts investors from both communities into the LEO community.</p>



<h4 id="security-of-assets">Security of Assets:</h4>



<p>There is security of funds guaranteed by a buyback from the issuing company. More so, the tokens are deployed in highly secured and scalable blockchains making the funds transfer swift, secure, and safe to use. There is also funds security guaranteed by the exchange security model because token holders will mostly have to store these tokens on the exchange to benefit in discounts attached to holding the asset.</p>



<h3 id="disadvantages-of-leo-coins"><strong>Disadvantages of LEO Coins</strong></h3>



<p>For every unique product, there is always a shortfall. Below is a list of possible disadvantages of LEO tokens.</p>



<h4 id="inaccuracy">Inaccuracy:</h4>



<p>There is a risk of inaccuracy in the data updated on the dashboard. This possible error in auditing might lead to trust issues in the business model or token economics associated with the token. This possible issue might affect token holders and investors who are waiting for a buyback of their LEO coin holdings.</p>



<h4 id="reduced-benefits">Reduced Benefits:</h4>



<p>Since the token is solely designed to raise funds and cover losses incurred during the hack with the support of investors who will benefit from discount in fees and buybacks, any possible withdrawal of these benefits without meeting investors&#8217; satisfaction might lead to distrust in LEO token economics. Investors will tend to withdraw from holding these tokens for discounts in using products and other services offered by the company.</p>



<h4 id="zero-choice-for-investors-nbsp">Zero Choice for Investors:&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The token will never be a better option for investors looking to invest in the LEO coin for the long-term. This is because the token will someday cease to exist, and it may or not have a significant price increase to help the issuing company in buying it back.</p>



<h4 id="price-manipulation-nbsp">Price Manipulation:&nbsp;</h4>



<p>There is a risk of manipulation in the price of the token, though the company is buying at the market price. This is because the issuing company is continuously buying back these tokens to take them out of circulation, which will tend to maintain a stable price close to the IEO price to protect investors too. The issuing company here has a big control over this token and the pricing. Since it&#8217;s buying the token back, there may or not be a possible significant increase or decrease in price to enable a buyback at a rate very much close to the price at fundraising (IEO).</p>



<h3 id="key-perspectives-and-takeaways"><strong>Key Perspectives and Takeaways</strong></h3>



<p>Bitfinex enabled trading with the LEO on May 20, 2018, after concluding the IEO on May 13, 2019. The tokens were tradable against BTC, USD, USDT, EOS, and ETH.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, under the LEO token economics, the iFinex company will repurchase and burn the outstanding LEO tokens using the funds recovered from the Crypto Capital in alleged illegal funds transmission between Tether Inc and Bitfinex amounting to $850 million. The repurchase, according to the team, will be done in multiple transactions solely under the discretion of the company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the same approach will be applied to the funds recovered from the 2016 hack, which is the reason behind the UNUS SED LEO token launch. The amount planned for use should be equal to 80% of the redeemed funds from the hack. There is reportedly a planned 18-month period for redemption.</p>



<p>There is this unique feature of future extinction attached to the token economics which will create trust and present a good public image of the company towards investors and the Bitfinex trading community.</p>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/flare-network-spark-airdrop" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spark Airdrop</a>: Spark Token is the native token of the Flare Network. This token will be airdropped to all XRP holders. This means that it has the same supply as XRP and will be available for claiming from Ripple token holders. Ripple token holders can claim their own portion of the XRP airdrop if they were holding on supporting exchanges or their own secured XRP wallet provided by Atomic Wallet during the snapshot.</p>



<p>What does it mean? It means that once you are holding XRP you can claim it if you were holding on exchanges that supported the airdrop snapshot before the snapshot date. Others who have theirs sitting on custodial and non-custodial wallets can still claim theirs without having to deposit on any of the supporting exchanges.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-store-and-manage-unus-sed-leo-coin">How to store and manage Unus Sed Leo Coin:</h3>



<p>You can manage and store LEO coins on numerous platforms that support the blockchain protocols on which it is issued. Atomic Wallet is the best platform amongst other platforms where you can store and manage your Leo tokens. Atomic Wallet is a highly secured multi-chain wallet that can be used to manage and store LEO coins across the two chains, Ethereum and EOS Blockchain. Atomic Wallet is the best multi-cryptocurrency wallet for storing multiple cryptocurrencies on different blockchains. It is a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/custodial-non-custodial-wallets-comparison" rel="noreferrer noopener">non-custodial wallet</a>&nbsp;that gives you full access and control over your funds and does not store user details on its server.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Conclusion: Unus Sed Leo Coin is proof that users and crypto platform operators or owners can work closely to secure the platform financially. While users benefit and use the platform, the platform operators can also work with its users to secure the platform during issues of financial crisis like the one we saw with the Bitfinex hack.</p>
