										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While the concept of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can be traced back to 2012, it&#8217;s only recently that they&#8217;ve garnered sustained attention from the mainstream media.</p>



<p>This has occurred as they&#8217;ve skyrocketed in popularity of late, with several high-profile sales having taken place through February and March this year. An original Banksy was recently burnt and destroyed as part of a viral live-streamed video before being&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56335948" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold via an NFT that represented the work for $380,000</a>.</p>



<p>In February, a classic LeBron James clip was sold in NFT form for $99,000, while a looping video clip iteration also changed hands for $26,128 around the same time.</p>



<p>This represents just the tip of the iceberg for NFTs, which have evolved considerably since their inception nine years ago.&nbsp;<strong><em>But what exactly is an NFT, and what are its most prominent use cases?</em></strong></p>



<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-non-fungible-tokens">A Brief History of Non-Fungible Tokens</h2>



<p>At its core, an NFT is simply a unique and non-interchangeable digital asset whose ownership is recorded on a blockchain. The word &#8216;fungible&#8217; means interchangeable, so assets categorized as NFTs simply cannot be exchanged as like-for-like entities on any particular network.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that virtually any piece of digital content can be minted into an NFT, from iconic Banksy artwork to songs and famous tweets. The scope and potential use cases for NFTs remain virtually endless. To this end, Twitter founder Jack Dorset recently put his first-ever tweet (from March 21st, 2006) up for auction in the form of an NFT. Bidding has already&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/jack-dorsey-posted-the-first-tweet-15-years-ago-now-its-selling-as-an-nft-3560699.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached $2.5 million at the time of writing</a>.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll further detail how NFTs work later in the piece, but arguably the first iteration of this technology existed in the form of colored coins. Colored coins were first discussed in a 2012 blog post written by Yoni Assia, with these entities consisting of small denominations of a single Bitcoin (BTC) token. Colored coins subsequently represented several assets across various use cases, including property, coupons, and company shares. Despite their complex nature, they represented a huge evolution in Bitcoin&#8217;s capabilities, while they also laid the foundation for the modern NFTs that we see replicated today. This partly inspired the launch of Counterparty in 2014, which was formed as a peer-to-peer financial platform and distributed an open-source protocol developed on top of the original Bitcoin blockchain. This allowed for asset creation within a decentralized exchange, while it also housed the first-ever game (Spells of Genesis) to issue in-game assets onto a blockchain in April 2015.</p>



<p>Similar projects followed as the concept of NFTs grew in popularity, although it wasn&#8217;t until October 2017 that it began to hit the mainstream. At this time, &#8216;CryptoKitties&#8217; was launched on Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain network, with this described as a blockchain-based virtual game that enabled players to adopt, raise, and trade virtual cats in the form of NFTs.</p>



<p>Coinciding with Bitcoin and the crypto market&#8217;s infamous bull run of 2017, the launch of this unique project hit the headlines, even featuring on mainstream news sites such as CNN. This was largely due to the relatively high profits available through trading. Simultaneously, the immense success and popularity of the game caused many to realize the full potential of leveraging NFTs.</p>



<p>Before this years&#8217; explosion of non-fungible token sales, 2018 and 2019 also saw considerable exponential growth within the NFT ecosystem. During this time, more than 100 high-profile projects were initiated. However, it&#8217;s fair to say that the trade volumes for NFTs and similar assets remained small about alternative cryptomarket niches.</p>



<p>Still, the market for selling NFTs as a digital representation of iconic artwork has exploded of late, with YouTube personality Logan Paul making more than $5 million selling such assets over two days as recently as February 2021.</p>



<p>Overall, it&#8217;s thought that musicians have now sold more than $4 million in NFTs throughout the global industry, with this number likely to increase exponentially in the near, medium, and long-term. We&#8217;ll explain why this may be the case a little later on.</p>



<h2 id="how-do-non-fungible-tokens-work">How Do Non-Fungible Tokens Work?</h2>



<p>As we&#8217;ve already touched on, digital content and records can be &#8216;minted&#8217; into NFTs, with this referring to the process of creating a unique file that exists on a particular blockchain.</p>



<p>In this process, the blockchain acts as a decentralized ledger that records and tracks each NFT while simultaneously displaying the associated transaction history. This data is subsequently coded to have a unique ID and other forms of metadata that no other NFT can replicate, creating a unique and immutable digital record that third parties cannot manipulate.</p>



<p>The software programs used to code non-fungible tokens are referred to as smart contracts, which are central to contemporary blockchains&#8217; appeal and can govern fundamental aspects such as the transfer and ownership of established NFTs. Like the vast majority of software and blockchain applications, NFTs can also be programmed far beyond ownership and transferability concepts. This allows individuals to access far greater functionality, including the capacity to link a particular NFT to an alternative type of digital asset.</p>



<p>Thanks to this transparent, immutable, and ultimately scalable process, NFTs are afforded scarce and originality attributes. This makes them particularly attractive when paired with digital media, while it also allows unique assets (such as Banksy artwork) to be replicated by NFTs without losing their inherent value. In this instance, a human asset is simply transferred into a digital one, with the value subsequently moved seamlessly onto the remaining NFT.</p>



<h2 id="why-non-fungible-tokens-are-all-the-hype-today">Why Non-Fungible Tokens are all the hype today</h2>



<p>Given that the history of NFTs can be traced back to 2012, the question that remains is why non-fungible tokens are all the hype today?</p>



<p>The first observation is that the diverse realms of gaming, art, and music have become increasingly digitized in recent times, both in terms of development and distribution. As a result, they&#8217;re increasingly compatible with the technology underpinning NFTs, creating an easy-to-understand and more appealing proposition for investors and artists.</p>



<p>From the sole perspective of artists, of course, the proliferation of NFTs provides a unique opportunity for them to sell their content in a completely novel and unique way. As a result, they can arguably sell even mediocre content at a price premium while simultaneously accessing free and often viral marketing through social media and traditional news networks.</p>



<p>Remember, NFTs also boast a tangible sense of scarcity and a traceable real-world link, which automatically increases the asset&#8217;s value while creating a new and exciting outlet for speculative money. Similarly, NFTs allow for quick and secure transactions that leverage the unique advantages of blockchain technology, with this particularly appealing for those whose motivation is grounded in getting rich quickly without compromising on the viability of individual transactions.</p>



<p>Of course, the newest surge of NFT sales is seeing people pay tens of thousands for assets that would otherwise arguably be freely available on social media. Such assets can include memes and animated gifs, with one particular animated cat altered to include a dogecoin token recently selling online for $69,000.</p>



<p>In this case, the NFT assets don&#8217;t boast any inherent value or real scarcity, so their popularity is a little harder to explain. This is until you begin to understand how hype itself continues to drive the market for NFTs, with this generating a significant buzz that draws attention to the wider crypto marketplace and the unique technology that underpins it.</p>



<h2 id="non-fungible-token-use-cases">Non-Fungible Token Use Cases</h2>



<p>As we&#8217;ve already seen, art and musical content have dominated the NFT niche, with aspects such as creation, copyright, and ownership highly important and lucrative within these spaces.</p>



<p>However, there are other prominent (albeit less obvious) use cases for non-fungible tokens, including the following:</p>



<h3 id="the-gaming-industry">The Gaming Industry</h3>



<p>As digital games such as CryptoKitties highlight, there has always been an affinity between gaming and NFT technology.</p>



<p>Certainly, the gaming industry has spent much of the last decade creating virtual economies within an individual game&#8217;s ecosystem. This is underpinned by the type of freemium model that characterizes World of Warcraft (WoW) Fortnite.</p>



<p>In the case of blockchain-based titles, NFTs enable players to trade in-game collectibles securely and in real-time while also guaranteeing authenticity and allowing for fully verified transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, gaming-related NFTs work similarly to some cryptocurrency networks, particularly as users can participate in their governance and offer input into discussions on future development within a particular game&#8217;s ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="sports">Sports</h3>



<p>There are various transaction challenges faced by fans across a diverse array of sports, from the sale of historic memorabilia without provenance to counterfeit merchandise and tickets&#8217; widespread deployment.</p>



<p>Make no mistake; using NFTs and blockchain technology can help eliminate these issues, as their immutable and transparent nature prevents counterfeit collectibles or tickets from being sold.</p>



<p>One iteration of this would see unique and tokenized game tickets issued directly on the blockchain network, providing a practical use case for NFTs while enabling buyers to protect themselves at all times. While each game ticket may be similar, every entity will be defined by unique identifiable information that connects it to the designated owner on the blockchain.</p>



<p>Going forward, it&#8217;s thought that sporting merchandise could ultimately be represented by NFTs, allowing the owner to register and verify official items as theirs.</p>



<h3 id="real-estate">Real Estate</h3>



<p>Real estate represents a slightly different use case for non-fungible tokens, while it is also one of the most interesting types of projects in the marketplace. In this example, a single property is fractionated into multiple assets, subsequently purchased by investors on a blockchain-based exchange network. This allows for collaborative ownership of individual properties, while it also provides a seamless and simplified transaction process whether you&#8217;re buying or selling a house. Most importantly, this eliminates the need for a third-party intermediary, potentially lowering the cost of buying and selling homes in the process.</p>



<p>By deploying NFTs as a form of smart contract, sellers can also minimize the risk of conflict or legal disputes about land ownership or a particular estate.</p>



<h3 id="erc-721-vs-erc-1155-vs-non-fungible-tokens-comparison">ERC-721 vs. ERC-1155 vs. Non-Fungible Tokens Comparison</h3>



<p>When titles such as Cryptokitties were first created on the Ethereum blockchain, developers sought out ways to enhance the standard of gaming through this medium. To this end, non-fungible tokens were developed using the ERC721 standard, which created a formal template that other participating developers agreed to follow from the outset.</p>



<p>However, we live in the age of third-generation blockchains, some of which offer similar functionality to Ethereum and have evolved the concept of decentralized gaming. As a result of this, Enjin has created a newer and approved Ethereum token standard, with this referred to as ERC1155.</p>



<h4 id="but-what-are-the-differences-between-these-standards-nbsp">But what are the differences between these standards?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Well, ERC-721 is limited to non-fungible tokens only, whereas the ERC1155 standard also makes allowances for fungible and interchangeable assets such as crypto tokens.</p>



<p>Currently, the ERC-721 standard only supports the transfer of a single token or asset at a time, while ERC1155 allows for much larger batch transfers that include numerous token IDs as part of a single transaction. Given that each Ethereum transaction takes between 15 and 30 seconds to complete attempting to transfer numerous ERC-721 tokens at once can be incredibly time-consuming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to smart contracts, ERC-721 assets require a separate and unique contract for every token iteration. However, ERC-1155 tokens can be deployed in a single, smart contract for infinite token and asset types, affording users far greater flexibility and autonomy when creating agreements between parties.</p>



<h3 id="the-10-most-famous-non-fungible-tokens-so-far">The 10 Most Famous Non-Fungible Tokens (So Far!)</h3>



<p>We&#8217;ll close with a list of the ten most famous and lucrative NFT transactions of all-time, highlighting the immense appeal and popularity of this asset class and how it exploded of late.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="these-include">These include:</h4>



<p><strong>10. Nyan Cat by Chris, on Foundation ($590,000):&nbsp;</strong>This featured the popular piece of Internet folklore called the Nyan cat meme, which sold for $590,000 (or 300 ETH) in February 2021.</p>



<p><strong>9. The Complete MF Collection by Beeple, on Nifty Gateway ($777,777.77):&nbsp;</strong>This unique NFT transaction combined blockchain-based art with an original, physical component and sold for a premium earlier this year.</p>



<p><strong>8. Hairy by Steve Aoki, on Nifty Gateway ($888,888.88):&nbsp;</strong>Similarly, musician Steve Aoki collaborated with Antoni Tudisco to produce a combination of the former&#8217;s music and a blue-and-purple figure while sold for a huge and rather specific sum of money.</p>



<p><strong>7. Not Forgotten, But Gone by WhlsBe, on Nifty Giveaway ($1 million):&nbsp;</strong>This 16-second video clip of a spinning, gold skeleton gummy bear was another sell recently on the Nifty Gateway platform and managed to reach the $1 million mark.</p>



<p><strong>6. Auction Winner Picks Name by SSX3LAU, on Nifty Gateway ($1.33 million):&nbsp;</strong>This example saw electronic music artist 3LAU join the NFT party. This major sale allowed the winner of an auction to name the song played in his next music video.</p>



<p><strong>5. CryptoPunk #6985, on Larva Labs ($1.54 million):&nbsp;</strong>This is the first CryptoPunk entry on our list, with this funky fedora one of the latest NFT sales to breach the coveted $1 million thresholds.</p>



<p><strong>4. First Tweet by Jack Dorsey on Valuables ($2.5 million or more):&nbsp;</strong>The auction above of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey&#8217;s first tweet closed on March 21st, with the final sale value sure to be $2.5 million or more when it&#8217;s finally confirmed.</p>



<p><strong>3. Crossroad by Beeple, on Nifty Gateway ($6.66 million):&nbsp;</strong>This is the second digital collection listed by Beeple, with this netting an incredible $6.66 million on the secondary sale market on February 24th.</p>



<p><strong>2. CryptoPunks #7804 and #3100 on Larva Labs ($7.6 million each):&nbsp;</strong>These two tradable CryptoPunk collectibles were sold on March 11th for a combined value of 4.2k Ethereum tokens, creating the second most valuable NFT transaction of all time.</p>



<p><strong>1. &#8220;Everydays: The First 5,000 Days&#8221; by Beeple, at Christie&#8217;s ($69 million):&nbsp;</strong>Beeple also produced the highest-selling NFT to date, with the crypto artist raising a staggering $69 million for a piece auctioned at the iconic Christies. This was a compilation of Beeple&#8217;s first 5,000 pieces of work, and we&#8217;re not sure that the record will be topped any time soon!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Initially scheduled to launch in Q3 of 2019, the long-awaited Polkadot protocol finally debuted in May 2020. A genuinely pioneering project based on an advanced multi-chain framework, it also introduced us to its native DOT token in August of last year.</p>



<p>The coin was launched with three primary purposes, namely staking, bonding, and providing governance over the network. Interestingly, DOT isn&#8217;t categorized as an ERC-20 coin, which means that it doesn&#8217;t follow the list of standards used to regulate exchanges on the Ethereum platform. Instead, it&#8217;s considered a blockchain-based cryptocurrency and one that saw its price fluctuate within the narrow range of $3.014564 and $5.251094 between August and December last year.</p>



<p>The end of 2020 saw something of a price hike for the cryptocurrency, however, with the Polkadot value breaking through the $10 barrier for the first time on January 6th. This trend has continued largely unabated during the subsequent four weeks, with the DOT price reaching a new high of $21.53 on February 4th. The Polkadot coin price is also poised for further growth in the coming weeks, with this generating continued speculation about the token and driving increased trading volumes in the process.</p>



<p>Those of you who hold DOT tokens in your wallet can manage these in the Atomic Wallet, of course, along with up to 500 additional coins.&nbsp;<strong><em>However, we&#8217;ll touch on this further a little later in the piece.</em></strong></p>



<h3 id="what-is-polkadot-dot">What is Polkadot (DOT)?</h3>



<p>The Polkadot project&#8217;s pioneering nature is borne out by its core premise, creating an advanced, third-generation peer-to-peer network for numerous blockchains.</p>



<p>The protocol was developed by the Swiss-based Web3 Foundation, utilizing a simple blockchain setup and allowing for interoperability between different and developing blockchains. The network is also defined by a sophisticated governance process, with its considerable promise underpinning a successful 2017 ICO, which raised more than $140 million. Despite this and raising more than $200 million from investors over the last three-and-a-half years, Polkadot also incurred significant losses during this period and saw its launch date continually delayed.</p>



<p>Following two separate rounds of the private sale in 2019 and 2020, however, the Polkadot mainnet was finally launched in May 2020. From its starting point of $2.70, the DOT coin price enjoyed an initial hike, and subsequent correction as early adopters realized their profits before soaring to its recent high above the $20 mark at the beginning of February.</p>



<p>Interestingly, some have discussed the striking similarities between Polkadot and Ethereum, particularly in terms of the facilitation of transactions between independent blockchains and the DOT coin&#8217;s reliance on staking rather than mining to govern network growth. Of course, these two technologies also share the same founder (Graeme Wood), creating a scenario where both assets have witnessed periodically strong price correlations since last summer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/dot-market-prediction.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-32712" ></figure>



<h3 id="a-market-prediction-for-the-polkadot-dot-price-in-2021"><em>A Market Prediction for the Polkadot (DOT) Price in 2021</em></h3>



<p>As we can see from the chart above, the Polkadot coin price, in particular, has seen significant growth during the last five weeks, thanks largely to a significant increase in demand and the increased availability of tokens across exchanges nationwide.</p>



<p>But what exactly will 2021 bring for the Polkadot coin price? Here&#8217;s a selection of opinions from crypto experts:</p>



<h3 id="coinpedia-polkadot-price-prediction-for-2021">Coinpedia Polkadot Price Prediction for 2021</h3>



<p>Coinpedia has predicted a sustained continuation of the DOT price rally that began at the end of 2020, based on technical analysis of the coin and its surrounding network. More specifically, they forecast Polkadot price gains of up to 25% during the first half of 2021 alone, with the token poised to close out the year around the $50 mark.</p>



<h3 id="digitalcoinprice-dot-price-prediction-for-2021">Digitalcoinprice DOT Price Prediction for 2021</h3>



<p>The experts at Digitalcoinprice largely share the opinion of their counterparts at Coinpedia, although they&#8217;re marginally less aggressive in their forecasts. They&#8217;ve correctly predicted Polkadot&#8217;s current price and that the token would break through the $20 barrier in early 2021, making their bullish forecasts of 100% price growth over the year seem more than feasible.</p>



<h3 id="walletinvestor-polkadot-price-prediction-for-2021">Walletinvestor Polkadot Price Prediction for 2021</h3>



<p>Walletinvestor is renowned for creating forecasts based on AI-generated technical analysis, although this has revealed a much less positive outlook for DOT&#8217;s future. It predicts that the DOT price will plunge by around 90% to $1.541 during the next 12 months, but this is largely based on intangible factors and should probably be taken with a pinch of salt. This Polkadot price prediction also appears unlikely given the DOT&#8217;s current price and trajectory.</p>



<h3 id="coinarbitragebot-polkadot-price-prediction-for-2021">CoinArbitrageBot Polkadot Price Prediction for 2021</h3>



<p>The forecast from CoinArbitrageBot treads the middle ground between our previous predictions, estimating a slight decline in value to $14.7503 from DOT&#8217;s current price by the end of 2021. This is based largely on DOT&#8217;s historical price data, although its longer-term outlook for the token is considerably more positive.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/RippleCoinNews-Polkadot-Price-Prediction.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-32701" ></figure>



<h3 id="ripplecoinnews-polkadot-price-prediction-for-2021">RippleCoinNews Polkadot Price Prediction for 2021</h3>



<p>Our final input comes from RippleCoinNews, which has forecast steady growth for the Polkadot price throughout 2021 (from its starting point of just $9.025999 at the beginning of the year). After peaking at $27.39 in February, it will trade within a narrow range and achieve a value of $23.68 by the end of the year, representing one of the most modest Polkadot predictions.</p>



<h3 id="dot-price-prediction-for-2021">DOT Price Prediction for 2021</h3>



<p>There&#8217;s a mix of opinions about DOT&#8217;s short-term growth prospects through 2021, with our selected Polkadot price predictions suggesting that the token&#8217;s value could be anywhere between $1.541 and $40 by the end of the year.</p>



<p>Coinpedia, Digitalcoinprice, and RippleCoinNews all produced accurate forecasts for February of this year and continue to suggest that the DOT token will see either modest or exponential price growth as 2021 unfolds. This certainly makes sense when you consider that the token is becoming more widely accessible on international exchanges; the decision of asset manager 21Shares to launch a Polkadot ETP on Switzerland&#8217;s SIX exchange will enable even more&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/93495/21shares-launching-polkadot-dot-etp" rel="noreferrer noopener">investors to hold the native DOT coin as stock</a>.</p>



<p>This is not the only piece of Polkadot news to wow investors of late. The Mantra Network has recently&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/manta-aims-to-bring-a-private-decentralized-exchange-to-polkadot-with-1-1m-raise" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed a $1.1 million funding round</a>&nbsp;to create a fully decentralized and private exchange protocol. This swell of positive Polkadot news and a significant increase in demand, which will be further fuelled by the promising nature of the protocol and the DOT&#8217;s sustained rise against the dollar, should drive noticeable price hikes in the near-term and throughout 2021.</p>



<h3 id="the-dot-coin-price-prediction-for-2025">The DOT Coin Price Prediction for 2025</h3>



<p>If we look to 2025, we see similarly bullish forecasts for the DOT price. In the case of Coinpedia, for example, they&#8217;ve made a maximum DOT price prediction of $70.20 for the end of 2022, while the four-year outlook through 2025 sees the token rally between $120 and $150.</p>



<p>Other experts are a little more conservative with their DOT price predictions, of course, with Trading Beasts expecting the token to break through the $40 barrier by the end of 2024. However, the maximum price around this time could push the $50 mark before growing by a further 100% in the subsequent 12 months until the end of 2025.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s an undeniably bullish outlook for Polkadot and its native token through 2025, especially as the protocol begins to fulfill its immense potential as an interoperable blockchain. The predicted devaluation of the US dollar could also fuel price rises in this respect, as will further commercial partnerships and positive Polkadot news stories as they&#8217;re announced.</p>



<h3 id="our-polkadot-price-prediction-verdict">Our Polkadot Price Prediction Verdict</h3>



<p>The DOT current price is certainly embarked on an upward trajectory, with this also being influenced by a surge in sentiment for second-generation tokens such as Ethereum and Ripple. With most experts also predicting sustained growth through 2022 and 2025, there&#8217;s no doubt that Polkadot represents an interesting investment option from a short&nbsp;<strong><em>and</em></strong>&nbsp;medium-term perspective.</p>



<p>With price growth over 100% forecasted by some experts over the next 12 months alone, now may also be the ideal time to invest in Polkadot tokens. This is especially true when you consider Polkadot&#8217;s value in real-time, which remains genuinely competitive compared to other coins. Currently, the DOT coin price about Bitcoin remains as low as 0.000536 BTC, so there&#8217;s a clear window of opportunity to exchange tokens to generate a profit.</p>



<p>The good news is that you achieve this while managing your DOT coins in the Atomic Wallet, creating an opportunity for you to buy or exchange up to 500 different tokens. You can also stake DOT tokens with annualized returns of around 5% while benefiting from 24-hour support.</p>



<p>The Atomic platform is also secure and allows for complete anonymity, as your private keys are completely encrypted and there&#8217;s no need for any identifiable accounts or additional Know Your Customer (KYC) protocol.</p>



<h3 id="how-to-buy-the-dot-coin">How to Buy the Dot Coin</h3>



<p>If you decide to buy DOT sooner rather than later in 2021, the Atomic Wallet is the ideal place to get started. Simply install the Atomic Wallet on your desktop or mobile device before initially verifying your identity to negate the risk of theft or fraud. You&#8217;ll have to provide clear copies of photo identification such as a passport or drivers&#8217; license to achieve this aim, with this typical across most wallets and exchanges.</p>



<p>You can then get started with as little as $50 while funding your new wallet with your choice of credit and debit cards. You&#8217;ll then receive DOT tokens into your wallet, where you can securely store your coins alongside other assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. If you&#8217;re a mobile user, you can download the Atomic Wallet on both iOS and Android devices, while you can check out the various currencies accepted&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/polkadot-wallet" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<h3 id="how-to-exchange-dot-coin">How to Exchange DOT Coin</h3>



<p>There are various advantages to exchanging DOT coins in the Atomic Wallet, particularly when considering the huge range of exchange pairs available to investors. Not only this, but Atomic Wallet also offers genuinely competitive rates, allowing you to make the most of your investment and optimize your profitability over time.</p>



<p>You can also participate in Atomic&#8217;s first decentralized wallet program based on its native token (AWC). To take part, simply buy and hold a minimum of 100 AWC in your wallet before exchanging this for DOT tokens and similar assets at a preferential rate.</p>



<p>With this membership program, you&#8217;ll also receive cashback and rewards distributed regularly, with Platinum members&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/membership" rel="noreferrer noopener">able to redeem 1% every month</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CARDANO-PRICE-PREDICTION-2021-1918x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34295" ></figure>



<p>While Cardano was founded way back in 2015, this third-generation blockchain network didn&#8217;t officially launch until two years later. Its proprietary ADA token followed in the autumn of 2017, entering the market for $0.0130.</p>



<p>The Cardano network is built on genuinely revolutionary blockchain technology, with its multilayered architecture and protocols underpinned by core mathematical principles and in-depth, peer-reviewed research.</p>



<p>The ADA coin is pivotal to the network&#8217;s settlement layer, which is fully operational and allows users to send and receive tokens between wallets (we&#8217;ll have a little more on this later). Now that the computational layer is reaching maturity and beginning to underpin various smart contracts and commercial partnerships, the demand for ADA coins is thriving.</p>



<p>This surge in demand is reflected by the ADA coin price, which broke through the $1 barrier in January 2018 for the first time and, after correcting, has spent three years looking to get back there. July 2020 saw some price growth after about a year of little activity, but it wasn&#8217;t really until November 2020 that saw Cardano become hot property. As of February 9th, we have now seen Cardano&#8217;s tip of $0.71, from a year start of $0.18, offering impressive results to early investors.</p>



<p>While this may be lower than the ADA all-time price high of $1.33 achieved on January 4th, 2018, it should be noted that this occurred in the crypto bull market that followed Bitcoin&#8217;s historic price run in 2017. The ADA price subsequently crashed by around 90% to $0.14 in early April 2019.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The current growth trend appears to be far more sustainable, so there has arguably never been a better time to hold ADA coins and manage these as part of your portfolio in the Atomic Wallet.&nbsp;<strong><em>But what&#8217;s our ADA price prediction and outlook for 2021 and beyond?</em></strong></p>



<h3 id="what-is-cardano-ada">What is Cardano (ADA)?</h3>



<p>There&#8217;s a subtle distinction between Cardano and ADA. The former is the name of an overarching blockchain protocol, and the latter refers to the cryptocurrency that&#8217;s widely traded on exchanges.</p>



<p>The Cardano blockchain began its journey back in 2015, under Charles Hoskinson&#8217;s guidance (who played a prominent role in developing the Ethereum network) and Jeremy Wood.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2017, Hoskinson also became the CEO of IOHK, which subsequently built Cardano&#8217;s unique blockchain and helped launch the ADA token into the cryptocurrency marketplace. Hoskinson utilized his skills and experience as a mathematician to create the network&#8217;s key point of difference, embodied by a mathematically driven consensus mechanism that&#8217;s incredibly secure and (most importantly) scalable. There&#8217;s no doubt that the core functionality of Cardano is based on the ADA coin, which can be used to process real-time exchanges and transactions&nbsp;<strong><em>or&nbsp;</em></strong>held as a secure store of wealth over time.</p>



<p>A maximum of 45 billion ADA tokens was made available to users at the time of launch, with the current circulation estimated to be slightly north of 31 billion. Approximately 16% of this haul went to the project&#8217;s founders at the outset, of course, with the remaining 84% split amongst various investors following a protracted and highly successful $4 billion ICO in early 2017.</p>



<p>Cardano is currently a total market capitalization of $21 billion, with this having increased from $600 million following the asset&#8217;s debut. Like the ADA price, this is considerably lower than the $33 billion peaks in January 2018, but it has continued to enjoy marked and sustained growth since Q4 2020.</p>



<h3 id="the-cardano-price-chart">The Cardano Price Chart</h3>



<h3 id="the-market-prediction-for-cardano-price-2021">The Market Prediction for Cardano Price 2021</h3>



<p>The above chart certainly highlights the sharp upward price trajectory enjoyed by the network and its ADA coin during the last 12 weeks, with demand continuing to soar on the back of positive Cardano news stories and significantly higher rates of adoption.</p>



<p>But what will the remainder of 2021 have in store for the ADA price? Here&#8217;s a selection of the most trusted and considered ADA price predictions for the year.</p>



<h3 id="coinpedia-8217-s-cardano-price-prediction-2021">Coinpedia&#8217;s Cardano Price Prediction 2021</h3>



<p>The outlook is certainly bright, according to Coinpedia, which has forecast that the current ADA price growth will continue throughout 2021. According to the crypto experts, it&#8217;s almost certain to record a new all-time high during this period, while the token could be priced as high as $3.50 by the end of the year.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="walletinvestor-com-8217-s-cardano-price-prediction-2021">Walletinvestor.com&#8217;s Cardano Price Prediction 2021</h3>



<p>Walletinvestor.com is renowned for utilizing AI-generated technical analysis, which typically produces more bearish and less tangible price predictions. In the case of Cardano and the ADA price, the expert predicts a sharp decline to as low as $0.157 during the first half of 2021, before a late surge that leaves the token valued somewhere between $0.273 and $0.402.</p>



<h3 id="long-forecast-8217-s-cardano-price-prediction-2021">Long Forecast&#8217;s Cardano Price Prediction 2021</h3>



<p>According to the Long Forecast website, the ADA price could be poised to break the $2 barrier by the end of 2021. This is a relatively bullish price prediction, with steady growth being forecast throughout the year. By December, the ADA price could range somewhere between $1.85 and $2.30, with annual growth of up to 532% predicted over the course of the next 11 months.</p>



<h3 id="digitalcoinprice-com-8217-s-cardano-price-prediction-2021">DigitalCoinPrice.com&#8217;s Cardano Price Prediction 2021</h3>



<p>DigitalCoinPrice is also forecasting consistent growth through 2021, although this expert sees the ADA price appreciating much more steadily than many contemporaries. It sees the token trading at an average price of $0.62 in the months ahead, although the higher end of its forecast could see the token breach the $1 mark for the first time.</p>



<h3 id="tradingbeast-8217-s-cardano-price-prediction-2021">TradingBeast&#8217;s Cardano Price Prediction 2021</h3>



<p>We close with another relatively bullish Cardano price prediction, with TradingBeasts estimating that the token could see its average value reach $0.830845 by December 2021. At this time, the coin&#8217;s maximum price could trade as high as $1.0385618, while even the minimum forecast of $0.7062220 may offer appeal to investors.</p>



<h3 id="ada-price-prediction-2021">ADA Price Prediction 2021</h3>



<p>While there&#8217;s quite a diverse mix of opinions concerning the precise ADA price prediction for 2021, there&#8217;s an overwhelming consensus that the coin is expected to enjoy broadly consistent growth over the course of the next 11 months, at least. Cardano&#8217;s ADA token has already been appreciated by more than 100% since February 1st. The network upgraded its delegation interface on Daedalus and became the focus of several positive news stories online and across social media channels.</p>



<p>One particular Cardano news item reported the successful launch of a smart contract on its testnet. Simultaneously, the network&#8217;s high-profile partnerships with IBM and PriceWaterhouseCoopers (both of which were announced in January) have also generated a significant buzz and increased demand for the ADA token online.</p>



<p>Given the similarities between Cardano and the Ethereum networks, the former could also benefit from the latter&#8217;s continued struggles with increased congestion and high gas fees (which are becoming synonymous with first and second-generation blockchains across the board). This opportunity is based on Cardano&#8217;s immense scalability and the ADA token&#8217;s capacity for staking, which may also underpin long-term price growth through 2025.</p>



<h3 id="ada-price-prediction-through-2025">ADA Price Prediction Through 2025</h3>



<p>The ADA price predictions through 2021 provide a clear consensus for consistent but variable growth, while it appears as though this trend will continue over the next five years or so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the bullish end of the ADA price prediction for 2025, Coinpedia is forecasting that the token could break the $10 barrier during this period. This is mainly built on the long-term potential and scalability of the more comprehensive Cardano network, which could also send the price towards the $8 mark by the end of 2022.</p>



<p>However, other forecasts are far more bearish, with CoinSwitch predicting that Cardano may not break the $2 barrier until some time in 2023. By 2025, it forecasts that the ADA price will touch $3, as it weighs the scalability and unique premise of the network&#8217;s protocols against the potential for increased competition from similar, third-generation blockchains.</p>



<p>The ADA price prediction through 2025 may also depend in part on the performance of the USD dollar. Make no mistake; the ADA price USD rate increase has been driven in part by the devaluation of the greenback through 2020, so this is something for investors to bear in mind going forward.</p>



<h3 id="our-cardano-price-prediction-verdict">Our Cardano Price Prediction Verdict</h3>



<p>The key takeaway here is clear; while Cardano is an undeniably interesting investment option and one that&#8217;s poised for relatively consistent growth through 2025, there remains a diversity of opinion about how much the asset&#8217;s price will grow during this period.</p>



<p>Our expert&#8217;s ADA price predictions suggest that the token could be priced anywhere between $0.273 and $3.50 by the end of 2021 alone. By 2025, the high-end price forecasts range between $3 and $10, with factors such as increased market competition and USD price fluctuations representing key variables in this respect.</p>



<p>When you also consider Cardano&#8217;s current price point and immense potential as a third-generation blockchain, the asset arguably offers optimal value as a long-term investment option. This is also borne out by the network&#8217;s much-publicized Ouroboros Hydra protocol, which allows Cardano to scale considerably over time and maintain its capacity for instantaneous transactions even as its user base swells. According to some reports, the Hydra protocol could scale to handle more than one million transactions per second overtime, eclipsing even established existing payment solutions such as Visa in the future.</p>



<p>This type of Cardano protocol could certainly drive sustained price growth beyond 2025, so now may be the ideal time to invest in ADA and store the coin in your Atomic Wallet.</p>



<h3 id="how-to-buy-the-ada-coin">How to Buy the ADA Coin</h3>



<p>While you can&#8217;t currently buy ADA tokens on the Atomic Wallet, this is one of the best resources for storing, exchanging, and staking the token.</p>



<p>So, once you&#8217;ve identified the platforms that&nbsp;<strong><em>do</em></strong>&nbsp;sell ADA coins at the most competitive rates of exchange, you can transfer these directly into your Atomic Wallet and benefit from this platform&#8217;s incredible level of security. You can also manage your ADA coins alongside more than 300 alternative tokens, including market-leading entities such as Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum.</p>



<p>The Atomic Wallet also allows for staking, which refers to the process of earning cryptocurrency by merely holding it (which is ideal given the long-term appeal of Cardano) and delegating tokens to validators who approve transactions. You can currently stake Cardano and earn an ROI of up to 5.1% through transactions on the Atomic Wallet, providing a steady return to investors in the process.</p>



<h3 id="how-to-exchange-ada-coins">How to Exchange ADA Coins?</h3>



<p>Atomic Wallet also benefits from some genuinely competitive exchange rates, which is ideal if you intend to branch out into other cryptocurrencies in the relatively bullish marketplace that exists at present. Aside from this and the sheer range of alternative tokens supported by the Atomic Wallet, you can exchange coins instantly and benefit from the most competitive rates in real-time.</p>



<p>This particular advantage is at least partially driven by Atomic Wallet&#8217;s advanced backend system, which can also aggregate data from a diverse range of trusted sources and deliver this information accurately in real-time. This can encourage more informed decision making over time, which is pivotal in a fast-paced marketplace such as cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>On a final note, Atomic is also the first decentralized wallet to launch a membership program on the back of its native AWC token. All customers holding AWC tokens will receive rewards for using the platform&#8217;s built-in exchange service, with the precise amount of cashback on offer depending on your membership tier (including Blue, Silver, Gold, and Platinum).</p>



<p>To participate in this scheme, you&#8217;ll need to buy and hold a minimum of 100 AWC (1,000 AWC tokens will be required for Platinum membership). Then, exchange this with BNB or on Binance Dex as required. This is then available to be exchanged with any asset in Atomic Wallet (including ADA), with the total value of cashback counted on your AWC-BNB balance).&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CHAINLINK-PRICE-PREDICTION-2021-1918x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34293" ></figure>



<p>Chainlink&#8217;s journey from initial concept to fully functioning oracle network has been a challenging one, with its official launch in September 2017 coming three years after the formation of its parent company SmartContract.com.</p>



<p>On September 21st, 2017, however, the network&#8217;s patented LINK token was finally released into the marketplace at an initial price of $0.195428.</p>



<p>The LINK price enjoyed modest growth following its launch, reaching $1.188373 by the end of May 2019. On June 1st, however, Chainlink&#8217;s mainnet went live on the Ethereum network, enabling the network to start fulfilling its immense potential as a secure and decentralized oracle.</p>



<p>This effectively can connect deterministic blockchains with off-chain datasets and various APIs, bridging the gap between the physical and virtual worlds while allowing for the delivery of entirely intuitive smart contracts in real-time.</p>



<p>As a genuinely game-changing ERC-20 token that&#8217;s fully compatible with the Ethereum network, it should come as no surprise that the LINK price has embarked on a mostly steep and upward trajectory over the last 20 months.</p>



<p>To this end, the LINK price managed to break through the $3 barrier at the end of June 2019 before continuing its sharp ascent to an impressive $17.258631 on August 18th last year.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the Chainlink price contracted by as much as 42% in September last year, as part of a broader decline amongst DeFi tokens precipitated by growing macroeconomic and geopolitical anxiety in more traditional markets.</p>



<p>Despite further fluctuations throughout autumn 2020, however, the LINK price has rebounded strongly at the beginning of the New Year. As of February 10th, it had reached a new high of $28.057369, up by 8.4% in the previous 24 hours alone.</p>



<h3 id="what-is-chainlink-link">What is Chainlink (LINK)?</h3>



<p>You can buy, exchange and manage your LINK tokens in the Atomic Wallet, of course, but what&#8217;s the history of this coin and the network that it underpins?</p>



<p>The network itself is the brainchild of SmartContract.com, which was launched back in 2014 to revolutionize business contracts across a range of industries and create a demonstrably secure link between private data and public blockchains.</p>



<p>However, this premise initially ran into a significant problem. It was required to use centralized oracles that allowed third parties to retain control over data&nbsp;<strong><em>and&nbsp;</em></strong>created a scenario where smart contracts could be subsequently amended (rendering Chainlink&#8217;s on-chain network elements mostly obsolete).</p>



<p>So, SmartContract.com&#8217;s CEO Sergey Nazarov sought to resolve this issue by developing his decentralized oracle, with Chainlink finally launching following a lucrative, $32 million ICO in September 2017.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The LINK token is equipped with so-called &#8220;transfer and call&#8221; functionality, which allows it to be instantly and securely processed by smart contracts as part of individual transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also drives Node operators&#8217; compensation within the Chainlink network, who work to retrieve data from external sources efficiently and securely.&nbsp;<strong><em>This is pivotal to Chainlink&#8217;s decentralized oracle&#8217;s functionality, ensuring that such information is transferred securely and remains completely immutable</em></strong>.</p>



<h3 id="link-price-chart">LINK Price Chart</h3>



<h3 id="market-prediction-for-chainlink-link-price-2021">Market Prediction for Chainlink (LINK) Price 2021</h3>



<p>The above chart highlights the steep upward trajectory of the Chainlink price, with the rate of growth particularly pronounced following the launch of the network&#8217;s mainnet in June 2019.</p>



<p>But will this trend continue through 2021, and what impact will the broader economic climate and breaking Chainlink news stories and developments have on the LINK price?&nbsp;<strong><em>Let&#8217;s find out.</em></strong></p>



<h3 id="coinpedia-8217-s-chainlink-price-prediction-2021">Coinpedia&#8217;s Chainlink Price Prediction 2021</h3>



<p>Coinpedia successfully forecast the hike in Chainlink&#8217;s price at the beginning of the year, as the asset broke through the $25 barrier on February 6th before reaching its exalted high of $28.057369. Coinpedia predicts that LINK price is likely to rise further in the near-term, particularly as it continues to secure blue-chip partnerships. By the end of the year, this expert forecasts that the coin may peak above $50.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="digitalcoinprice-com-8217-s-chainlink-price-prediction-2021">DigitalCoinPrice.com&#8217;s Chainlink Price Prediction 2021</h3>



<p>The team at DigitialCoinPrice has made a similar (albeit slightly more modest) Chainlink price prediction for 2021, as they estimate that the LINK token will peak at $41.77 by the end of the year. This hints at a steady price growth of just under 50% during the next 11 months and highlights Chainlink&#8217;s value proposition&#8217;s relatively stable nature.</p>



<h3 id="walletinvestor-com-8217-s-chainlink-price-prediction-2021">Walletinvestor.com&#8217;s Chainlink Price Prediction 2021</h3>



<p>While Walletinvestor&#8217;s AI-based technical analysis tends to deliver bearish crypto predictions, Chainlink has managed to buck this trend. This expert predicts that the LINK token will achieve a value of $42.343 by the end of 2021, establishing Chainlink as a potentially outstanding long-term investment option.</p>



<h3 id="gov-capital-8217-s-chainlink-price-prediction-2021">Gov Capital&#8217;s Chainlink Price Prediction 2021</h3>



<p>According to Gov Capital, Chainlink will continue to grow in value throughout 2021, potentially reaching a high price of $37.617986 by the end of the year. This LINK price prediction is based on deep learning and a fully customized algorithm, while its comparatively bearish nature is reflected by an average value forecast of $33.006 during the year.</p>



<h3 id="tradingbeast-8217-s-chainlink-price-prediction-2021">TradingBeast&#8217;s Chainlink Price Prediction 2021</h3>



<p>We close with the most bearish Chainlink price prediction of all, as TradingBeasts forecasts that the asset will be trading at an average price of just $23.379 by the end of 2021 (a decline of nearly 10% on its current value). However, the maximum price forecast of $29.224 by the end of the year could be a little more accurate, especially given the token&#8217;s recent trajectory.</p>



<h3 id="chainlink-price-prediction-2021">Chainlink Price Prediction 2021</h3>



<p>There&#8217;s little doubt that the TradingBeast Chainlink price prediction is something of an outlier, with the vast majority of experts forecasting that the asset will achieve a breakout above $35 and potentially push as high as $50 by the end of 2021. Such price predictions are also consistent with the growth rate reported since the beginning of the year, with the LINK price having increased by more than 58% between January 1st and February 10th.</p>



<p>More bullish price predictions also reflect the increased rate of Chainlink adoption amongst a diverse range of blue-chip partners, including Oracle, Google Cloud, and SWIFT. The ground-breaking agreement with SWIFT has been incredibly beneficial by lending credibility to the Chainlink network while reaffirming its ability to transfer large swathes of external data securely through a decentralized oracle.</p>



<p>Chainlink is beginning to deliver on its initial premise while seeing increased adoption rates in lucrative retail and banking sectors. Its partnership with oracle services such as Provable (which was forged in March 2019) is also continuing to drive decentralization throughout the global financial services sector, creating incredible scope for further growth throughout 2021 and beyond.</p>



<h3 id="chainlink-price-prediction-2025">Chainlink Price Prediction 2025</h3>



<p>The immense and growing potential of Chainlink is inarguable, with the apparent consensus for sustained growth also expected to continue through 2025.</p>



<p>Coinpedia has forecast that the LINK price will soar as high as $60 during the first quarter of 2022, for example, while potentially breaking out above $100 by the end of next year. This expert also maintains a bullish outlook through 2025, thanks to Chainlink&#8217;s diverse range of partnerships and the network&#8217;s vast treasury of reserve funds.</p>



<p>Such factors should drive exponential growth during the next four years, with Chainlink expected to be priced as high as $500 per coin by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>This forecast may also reflect the LINK price USD exchange rate in the future, with the greenback poised for a steep depreciation against the backdrop of ongoing stimulus measures. However, Coinpedia&#8217;s LINK price prediction through 2025 is undoubtedly higher than the market average, so it&#8217;s essential to keep this in mind as a long-term investor.</p>



<p>A more bearish and conservative outlook is provided by DigitalCoinPrice, which forecasts that the LINK coin price will start 2025 with a valuation of $71.94. By the end of 2025, it&#8217;s forecast to trade at an average price of $97.90, although it could easily breach the $100 barrier in, particularly favorable market conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="chainlink-price-prediction-verdict">Chainlink Price Prediction Verdict</h3>



<p>While predictions about the extent and pace of Chainlink&#8217;s price growth vary wildly, there&#8217;s no doubt that the asset will continue to appreciate between now and 2025. However, the asset&#8217;s undeniable potential for mainstream adoption and exponential price growth makes it an exciting investment option in the long-term, especially if it does begin to trade anywhere near $500 per token during this period.</p>



<p>The most recent Chainlink news has also revealed a further commercial partnership with financial market infrastructure Paxos, as the former continues to claim a larger share of the fast-growing DeFi marketplace. This agreement will see Paxos leverage Chainlink&#8217;s unique centralized oracle to make its asset-backed tokens available across the whole of the DeFi market, highlighting its strong on-chain fundamentals and the rising demand that exists for its blockchain functionality.</p>



<p>If the Chainlink price does appreciate at a rate similar to the one forecast by Coinpedia, then now is the ideal time to invest in LINK tokens and store these securely in your Atomic Wallet. You can also use this resource to manage your LINK tokens alongside a broad range of similar cryptocurrencies while exchanging coins conveniently and in real-time through a single interface.</p>



<h3 id="how-to-buy-chainlink">How to Buy Chainlink</h3>



<p>As we&#8217;ve already touched on, Chainlink&#8217;s native LINK token can now be purchased in several cryptocurrency exchanges, although it isn&#8217;t currently available to buy in the Atomic Wallet.</p>



<p>This is because LINK cannot be acquired on any exchange that takes fiat currencies at this time, although this could well change in the near-term.</p>



<p>However, once you&#8217;ve identified the exchanges that do sell LINK tokens at the most viable and competitive rates, you can transfer these coins straight into your Atomic Wallet and manage these effectively as part of a far broader cryptocurrency portfolio.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>You can store your LINK coins alongside more than 300 alternative tokens through the Atomic Wallet, including Bitcoin, Ripple, Litecoin, and Ethereum.</strong></p>



<p>You can also use&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/prices" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Atomic Wallet platform</a>&nbsp;to monitor the LINK price in real-time, alongside the exchange&#8217;s full range of tokens. It&#8217;s also possible to view the 24-hour price change and real-time trading volumes, making it easier to make more informed decisions when managing your wallet.</p>



<h3 id="how-to-exchange-chainlink">How to Exchange Chainlink</h3>



<p>We&#8217;ve already confirmed that you can&#8217;t buy LINK tokens through the Atomic Wallet while staking (which enables you to earn a return on specific coins by delegating stored tokens to validators who approve transactions) is also unavailable for this asset.</p>



<p>However, you can exchange your LINK tokens for up to 300 alternative tokens through the wallet, often at a highly competitive real-time rate. The sheer number of exchange pairs is imposing, enabling you to achieve optimal value when you look to trade new tokens within your portfolio.</p>



<p>You can also thank Atomic Wallet&#8217;s comprehensive back-end system for delivering accurate price data in real-time, as this aggregates information from numerous trusted sources before delivering this to end-users. Interestingly, Atomic Wallet may be about to add the LINK oracle as one of its trusted data sources, allowing for even more secure and favorable exchanges in the future.</p>



<p>The Atomic Wallet also boasts a membership program, which is founded on its own native AWC token. You can buy into this scheme as a Blue member with a minimum investment of 100 AWC coins before exchanging this with BNB or Binance Dex.</p>



<p>Then, you can carry out exchanges with any viable asset in the Atomic Wallet. At the same time, those of you who are willing to procure a minimum of 1,000 AWC tokens will automatically qualify for Platinum membership.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/STELLAR-PRICE-PREDICTION-2021-1918x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34290" ></figure>



<p>Stellar is an open-source and decentralized protocol designed purposely for the financial market. Stellar is well-known for its payment and digital currency solution it is providing to enterprises and individuals across the globe. The Stellar blockchain-based payment system supports the creation, management, and exchange of digital representations of any form of money. </p>



<p>By design, the Stellar protocol works with a unique token known as the<em>&nbsp;lumen</em>&nbsp;(XLM). As the native&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-cryptocurrency" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryptocurrency</a>&nbsp;of the Stellar network, it is incumbent on every account on the network to hold a small amount of XLM at all times. To mitigate the misuse of the network by bad actors, the lumen was issued to denominate network requirements and transaction fees.</p>



<p>The current stellar price is a little above $0.32 per coin and with a market capitalization of $7,124,896,216, making it the eleventh largest cryptocurrency in the world. XLM is up 142.4% in the last 30 days and 425.% in a year.</p>



<p>At the end of this piece, we expect to know what Stellar protocol is, what the team is up to, future XLM price predictions according to experts, and several exciting facts, including the latest Stellar news.</p>



<h3 id="what-is-stellar-xlm"><strong>What is Stellar (XLM)</strong></h3>



<p>The stellar network is an open-source and public-owned payment system for storing and moving digital assets. In its early stages, the network was poised to help users send and receive cross-border payments at very competitive fees. Eventually, Stellar stepped up its game to build a network of financial institutions that can work together using blockchain technology.</p>



<p>Jed McCaleb, founder of Mt. Gox (a then bitcoin exchange) and Co-founder of Ripple, teamed up with former lawyer Joyce Kim in 2014 to launch the Stellar network. At its launch, Stellar received an amount of $3 million in seed funding from Stripe, a financial service company, and since then, the project has grown in all aspects. Since its inception, Stellar has witnessed a significant increase in the number of global financial partners. It has also processed over 450 million operations by more than four million individual accounts and several other fascinating milestones.</p>



<p>Unlike other blockchains, Stellar works in a unique way. Stellar blockchain relies on independent computers in its network to oversee others&#8217; works without any central entity. These nodes ensure verification and update the ledgers every five seconds making Stellar one of the fastest blockchains for transactions. Stellar uses a unique consensus algorithm known as the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP). In comparison to Bitcoin&#8217;s Proof-of-work, SCP is much faster, configurable, and energy-efficient,</p>



<p>Lumen (XLM) is the native cryptocurrency of the Stellar protocol, mostly used to fuel transactions on the network. It also serves to prevent malicious actors who might want to take advantage of the network. XLM is an integral part of the universal payment system for digital money, Stellar. The XLM crypto has a circulating supply of 22 Billion XLM and a max supply of 50 Billion.</p>



<p>Stellar&#8217;s notable features include an asset exchange that users can seamlessly use to exchange digital assets like cryptocurrencies, forex, and securities. It also comes with a payment application for swift and cost-effective cross-border payments, an initiative to support the network and ecosystem&#8217;s contributors through voting, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Stellar-XLM-Price-Chart.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33156" ></figure>



<h4 id="market-prediction-for-stellar-xlm-price-2021"><strong>Market prediction for Stellar (XLM) price 2021</strong></h4>



<p>Analysts, price prediction websites, and retail traders have their predictions for XLM in the year 2021. While there might be variation, we must have different and distinct views on XLM price. This will help in making better financial decisions. Now let&#8217;s take a closer look at what these experts have to say about Stellar price USD in 2012:</p>



<h4 id="longforecast-stellar-price-prediction-2021"><strong>LongForecast Stellar Price Prediction 2021</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/LongForecast-Stellar-Price-Prediction-20210A.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33167" ></figure>



<p>Longforecast prediction agency for digital assets expects XLM to be trading between the $0.29 &#8211; $0.40 range by March. Stellar price USD will reach $0.37 by early August while closing around $0.31 per coin. In December 2021, XLM price will be ranging between $0.33 &#8211; $0.39 per Longforecast&#8217;s XLM price analysis.</p>



<h4 id="ripple-coin-news-stellar-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Ripple Coin News Stellar Price Prediction 2021</strong></h4>



<p>Ripple Coin News, a Ripple and crypto-focused news portal, is also making a bullish stance on Stellar price in 2021. Stellar value will be somewhere between the $0.30 &#8211; $0.50 price range according to the platform. Overall, they are optimistic regarding Stellar price in the interim and beyond.</p>



<h4 id="trading-beats-stellar-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Trading Beats Stellar Price Prediction 2021</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trading-Beats-Stellar-Price-Prediction-20210A.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33178" ></figure>



<p>Tradingbeats is one of the famous price prediction platforms for various digital assets. As per the projection made by Tradingbeats, Steller price is forecasted to reach $0.38 by the beginning of March and close to a few cents above the opening price of March. By December, they expect XLM to be trading at an average price of $0.41</p>



<h4 id="monetize-info-stellar-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Monetize.Info Stellar Price Prediction 2021</strong></h4>



<p>Monetize believes Stellar&#8217;s financial partners will have a significant impact on Stellar price USD in 2021. Stellar currently has big brands onboard and more coming in due course. Ripple happens to be one of Stellar&#8217;s competitors, and their (Ripple) ongoing lawsuit with the SEC might allow Stellar to grab some of the market shares. Monetize is projecting XLM to surpass its previous all-time high (ATH) of $0.60 by the end of the year with all these variables.</p>



<h4 id="walletinvestor-stellar-price-prediction-2021"><strong>WalletInvestor Stellar Price Prediction 2021</strong></h4>



<p>According to Walletinvestor&#8217;s website, which updates Stellar price prediction every three minutes and based on technical analysis, they believe XLM is not an excellent long-term investment. However, they anticipate the Stellar coin price to be somewhere around $ 0.34 by December 2021.</p>



<h4 id="stellar-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Stellar price prediction 2021</strong></h4>



<p>Stellar happens to be one of the big names when it comes to cryptocurrency. In an interview with CoinMarketCap last year, McCaleb explained the idea behind Stellar, which I believe summarizes all that the project is up to. He explained: &#8220;The whole original design of Stellar is that you can have fiat currencies and other kinds of forms of value run in parallel with each other and with crypto assets. This is super important to drive this stuff mainstream.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>About his explanation, Stellar, in some sense, can be related to Ripple as they are both payment-oriented. Stellar was initially based on Ripple Lab protocol, and along the line, the code was rewritten. Steller finds itself in a very competitive market, including traditional payment systems. Ripple, for instance, is thriving and growing steadily regardless of its issues with the SEC. Ripple has now overtaken Polkadot to secure the 4th position of top cryptocurrencies according to market cap. These external factors will have an immense influence on Stellar&#8217;s growth. They are subsequently reflecting in Stellar current price performance in the coming years.</p>



<p>Fundamentally, Stellar is way ahead of most of its competitors. It&#8217;s relatively cheaper (0.00001 XLM per transaction) and faster to send and receive cross-border payment than available solutions. The outbreak of the noble Coronavirus has led state heads, tech gurus, and medical experts to advocate and encourage the use of digital forms of payment in all of our financial dealings, if possible. This has once again reminded us of the essence of solutions like that of Stellars&#8217;, and as a result, people have grown interests in digital forms of payments. Stellar is likely to benefit as it has long before entered other regions, including Africa, South America, Asia, etc. This will get Stellar the needed exposure, and eventually, as more people get to invest in the currency, XLM price is bound to appreciate with time.</p>



<p>Also, the ecosystem of users and partners building on Stellar has grown massively since it launched. At the time of writing, Stellar has processed over 2.5 million operations in just 24hours, indicating how the network has improved over time. Stellar is an open financial infrastructure that helps large enterprise companies and developers build sophisticated financial products on its network. Notable top-brands onboarded and leveraging Stellar protocol include IBM, Bitbond, Bankhaus von der Heydt, SatoshiPay, Abra, and several others. The number of partners is expected to increase with measures being put in place to onboarded new entrants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If Stellar should keep working on its ecosystem, It won&#8217;t be a surprise to see a surge above Stellar current price. We might see XLM at $0.50 by June and possibly climbing to $1 by the end of 2021.</p>



<h3 id="stellar-price-prediction-2025"><strong>Stellar price prediction 2025</strong></h3>



<p>It is no surprise that experts have made different XLM price predictions for 2025. What we can deduce from the numerous XLM price predictions is that the majority is predicting in favor of a bullish market for XLM. Some forecasting platforms predict XLM to reach $0.7 &#8211; $0.79, which is realistic considering the time interval. The likes of CoinSwitch and Coinpedia are very optimistic about XLM trading around $5 in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="stellar-price-prediction-verdict"><strong>Stellar price prediction verdict</strong></h3>



<p>Stellar has been fantastic throughout the years, and it&#8217;s still relevant as of today. Most analysts are tipping as the catalyst that will drive XLM price to do with Stellar&#8217;s partners. Stellar has partnered with some top financial and tech companies, including IBM, Deloitte, Swipe, and others.</p>



<p>Early this year, the Ukraine government chose Stellar blockchain to deploy a central bank digital currency (CBDC) after several research years. Stellar is continuously reaching out to other governments and institutions that might consider building CBDCs on the network. When the numbers increase, Stellar coin price is likely to respond accordingly because most investors consider this fundamental analysis.</p>



<p>A critical evaluation of various opinions on Stellar coin price in the future indicates a very successful year for Stellar. But before considering XLM as a long-term investment, you will need a wallet that grants you full control of your money. Atomic Wallet serves as a complete package to get started with your XLM investments. With Atomic Wallet, you should be able to purchase, store and exchange Stellar Lumen in one place.</p>
