<h2 id="what-is-nem-xem"><strong>What is NEM (XEM)?</strong></h2>



<p>The New Economy Movement (NEM) is a &#8216;Smart Asset Blockchain&#8217; technology that seeks to develop a low-cost assets and data management system. NEM is a technologically-advanced blockchain that does not focus much on creating another altcoin. The platform aims to provide a means of inter-operation between private and public blockchains. Moreover, businesses can use NEM to transfer assets, including documents, tokens, and supply chains.</p>



<p>NEM.io, a non-profit organization based in Singapore, is in charge of the NEM project. In March 2015, NEM.io created NEM as a fork of NXT. NXT is another cryptocurrency and a payment network. However, NEM.io later went on to make its codebase. As a result, NEM became a hard fork, running a blockchain different from NXT. The native cryptocurrency for the NEM platform is XEM. XEM is a significant part of the futuristic NEM project.</p>



<p>As part of its unique features, NEM uses neither the proof-of-work nor proof-of-stake mechanism. There are various shortcomings to those consensus mechanisms. For example, in proof-of-work, miners with higher computing machines claim an undue advantage over miners with less-powerful computing power. Also, PoW is an energy-efficient process. Thus, it requires a stable power supply.</p>



<p>Proof-of-stake favors coin hoarders. Members who hold a large chunk of coins earn more from staking than retail holders. Moreover, proof-of-stake encourages storing or saving cryptocurrencies and not spending as it should be.</p>



<p>NEM uses the Proof-of-Importance and Harvesting mechanism. This strategy emphasizes the importance of investing in the NEM system. Participants need to have a minimum of 10,000 XEM coins vested in the network&#8217;s wallet. They will have to hold their tokens for a significant period at a 10% daily interest rate. Users can then generate new blocks and earn transaction fees. Likewise, the proof-of-importance algorithm rewards users for making transactions in the network. The system evaluates transaction amounts to boost the proof-of-importance score of users. After that, the best nodes in the network earn the most.</p>



<p>Harvesting is another crucial feature of NEM&#8217;s blockchain mechanism. The harvesting process is to replace mining. Mining is the standard process other blockchain platforms use to add new blocks to the network and validate transactions. However, like proof-of-work, mining is power-intensive and could be slow. On the other hand, harvesting only requires participants to lend their proof-of-importance score to a supernode. Supernodes instead of miners run the NEM ecosystem. Thus, users only have to connect their wallets, not particular hardware or computer.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, NEM tries to avoid participants&#8217; negligence and ensure that nodes on the system are functional. Thus, the network integrates the Eigentrust++ algorithm to balance the network load and also remove non-contributing nodes. As a result, the NEM blockchain is always efficient and uncongested.</p>



<h2 id="nem-price-chart"><strong>NEM Price Chart</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="720"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NEM-Price-Chart.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34497" ></figure>



<p>As the chart shows, the NEM coin price was once more than $2 per XEM. However, just like other cryptocurrencies, there was a massive dump in NEM price USD. At the close of 2018, the XEM price was less than $0.1. Binance listed NEM in late 2020 at about $0.1441 coin price. Since then, it has continued to increase in price. NEM current price as of this writing is 0.7350 USD.</p>



<h2 id="market-prediction-for-nem-xem-price-2021"><strong>Market Prediction for NEM (XEM) price 2021</strong></h2>



<p>The New Economy Movement (NEM) coin has fantastic properties worth discussing. However, NEM price USD has not gone back to a dollar since the massive dump in 2018. Following NEM news, the circulating supply of the coin is 8,999,999,999 XEM. Likewise, XEM total supply and maximum supply are all the same – 8,999,999,999. Thus, all XEM tokens are pre-mined and are in circulation. So, its supply might not be the reason for such a low price. XEM once had a market cap of over $14 billion. However, XEM&#8217;s current market capitalization is $6,701,987,678, with a daily trading volume of over $814,250,000.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, investors might be quite optimistic about the XEM price. The coin is number 14 on CoinMarketCap ranking, and it&#8217;s currently on over 81,000 watchlists. Does this mean traders believe in the token of the Smart Asset blockchain?</p>



<p>The XEM price chart shows an uptrend market for the coin on a daily timeframe. As said, Binance listed NEM not long ago, so this uptrend could quickly reverse. Meanwhile, the NEM coin price has a support level at $0.2 and $0.43.</p>



<h2 id="nem-predictions-2021"><strong>NEM Predictions 2021</strong></h2>



<h3 id="long-forecast-nem-price-prediction-for-2021"><strong>Long Forecast NEM Price Prediction for 2021</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="720"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Long-Forecast-NEM-Price-Prediction-for-2021.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34498" ></figure>



<p>Longforecast.com algorithm predicts NEM coin price to close at 2.47 USD by December 2021. This prediction will amount to over a 200% increase in NEM current price. Meanwhile, NEM price USD will continue to increase every month in 2021. However, according to Long Forecast&#8217;s predictions, the price increase will not last in the long run. Long Forecast predicts that XMR price will drop below $1 by 2025 as it is now.</p>



<h3 id="tradingbeasts-com-nem-predictions-for-2021"><strong>Tradingbeasts.com NEM Predictions for 2021</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="720"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tradingbeasts.com-NEM-Predictions-for-20210A.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34499" ></figure>



<p>Tradingbeasts.com has published bullish NEM news for 2021. Through the coming months in 2021, Trading Beasts predicts that NEM value will increase bit by bit. The site&#8217;s NEM predictions are realistic because volatility is inevitable in the crypto market. According to Trading Beasts expert prediction, XEM price will have a maximum of about $1 this year. However, their average NEM price prediction is different. NEM will have an average price of $0.92 in December, a minimum of $0.78, and a maximum of $1.15.</p>



<h3 id="wallet-investor-nem-price-predictions-for-2021"><strong>Wallet Investor NEM Price Predictions for 2021</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="720"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wallet-Investor-NEM-Price-Predictions-for-2021.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34500" ></figure>



<p>Wallet Investor is an expert prediction website that forecasts cryptocurrencies&#8217; prices using technical analysis and historical index. To them, XEM might be a bad investment in the next year. Their one-year prediction for the XEM coin is $0.677. However, they predict a 36% increase in NEM value within five years. Thus, by 2026, a $1,000 investment in XEM from now would yield $360 profit.</p>



<h3 id="nem-price-prediction-of-a-trading-view-analyst"><strong>NEM Price Prediction of a Trading View Analyst</strong></h3>



<p>In December 2020, an expert Trading View user, Mehdi_Rasouli94, published his NEM price chart analysis. He referred to NEM as &#8220;My favorite altcoin'&#8221; and pointed to a level around $2.5. &#8220;NEM will finally touch this line before 2022&#8221;, he wrote in his analysis. His support levels for the NEM chart lie at 0.02 USD and 0.23 USD. These two points are pivot support levels on the XEM price chart.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="720"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NEM-Price-Prediction-of-a-Trading-View-Analyst.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34501" ></figure>



<h3 id="digital-coin-nem-predictions-for-2021"><strong>Digital Coin NEM Predictions for 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Digitalcoinprice.com has predicted a relatively stagnant price movement for XEM in 2021. According to their prediction, XEM will reach $1.23 by April but will close below $1 by December. Judging by NEM current price, this prediction is realistic and achievable. Meanwhile, by 2025, Digital coin predicts that NEM price USD will be around $2.44.</p>



<h2 id="nem-price-prediction-2021"><strong>NEM Price Prediction 2021</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="720"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NEM-Price-Prediction-2021-1.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34502" ></figure>



<p>In 2021, NEM current price might increase significantly, at least over a dollar per XEM. However, there could be another sharp drop in NEM coin price. What factors might be responsible for any of these actions? The developers and management of the project continue to do more work and improve on NEM features. The update on Catapult, for example, will introduce a high-performance API gateway server with advanced scalability. Thus, the network can process more transactions per second and even facilitate messaging. Likewise, the update will enhance the easy exchange of assets within the blockchain. However, the full Catapult update is yet to launch.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, NEM Smart Asset technology has overtime seen actual use. Mijin commercial blockchain uses NEM&#8217;s technology to facilitate financial services in Japan and other places. When businesses integrate products and launch projects on the NEM platform, it also improves NEM value. When these projects succeed, they will add to the XEM use-case. NEM.io Foundation continues to do its best for the project. The Foundation ensures they introduce and educate individuals in the blockchain space about NEM&#8217;s potential. Consequently, NEM can see an international and worldwide adoption.</p>



<p>However, massive adoption can be challenging to achieve in the first few years of a project. Competition keeps growing in the blockchain ecosystem, and this could cause some setbacks for Nem.io Foundation. Other cryptocurrency projects also aim to provide solutions for smart assets and smart contracts on their networks. Examples are Waves (WAVES), Ardor (ARDR), Stratis (STRAT), and a significant stakeholder of decentralized finance, Ethereum (ETH). Remember, Ethereum is the second most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin.</p>



<p>NEM still has a long way before it can surpass some of its competitors. This setback could be terrifying NEM news. For NEM current price to pump drastically, the team needs to maintain uniqueness.</p>



<h2 id="nem-price-prediction-2025"><strong>NEM Price Prediction 2025</strong></h2>



<p>Various NEM predictions gave speculations as regards NEM coin price in the future. Meanwhile, 2025 is still a long way to go for the XEM coin, and a lot could happen between now and then. One inevitable player that can influence NEM price USD positively or the other way is Bitcoin price. Bitcoin predictions for 2025 are mostly bullish, and some experts predict a six-figure price for BTC by then. If Bitcoin should pump as hard as predicted, several altcoins, including XEM, will follow suit. Some altcoins will also increase even when the Bitcoin price remains stagnant. However, if BTC price should drop below expectations (which is not feasible), this could cause bad NEM news.</p>



<p>NEM is a futuristic project that is compatible with adoption. When released, the update on Catapult will allow it to process up to 3,000 payments per second. The adoption rate of XEM cannot be over-emphasized if its price will surge in 2025 and beyond.</p>



<p>Beyond NEM features and Bitcoin price movement, expert opinions can also drive in investors. Expert NEM predictions of Digital Coin speculates that XEM price USD will sell above $2 by 2025.</p>



<p>However, as above, Long Forecast still sees NEM value below $1 by 2025.</p>



<h2 id="nem-price-prediction-verdict"><strong>NEM Price Prediction Verdict</strong></h2>



<p>NEM has something unique to offer, and these features apply to real-world events and practical usage. The NEM platform brings Namespaces to the blockchain ecosystem. Namespaces are like domain names of websites on the World Wide Web, and therefore NEM allows users and businesses to create their domain names on the NEM network.</p>



<p>Multi-signature transactions are another feature of the NEM blockchain. Multi-signature transactions enable businesses or companies who use NEM to track the activities on their account. Thus, these businesses can expand quickly and still retain complete control of their assets. NEM&#8217;s proof-of-importance and harvesting is an added advantage as this mechanism is neither power-intensive nor expensive. All these excellent qualities of the NEM network are add-ons that could drive XEM prices higher.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, NEM has seen some other real-world applications so far, including a partnership in UAE. Also, the launch of a Blockchain Hub where NEM provides support for start-ups innovating on its blockchain.</p>



<p>On March 15, 2021, NEM will launch a new blockchain known as Symbol. The Symbol is a public blockchain, and NEM NIS1 will be migrating into Symbol after its launch. The Symbol will be a tool to connect businesses with the NEM ecosystem. The new blockchain might be the tool NEM needs to facilitate interoperability between private and public blockchains. Meanwhile, we cannot fully ascertain if Symbol is built for that yet. The token for the new Symbol blockchain is XYM. During its launch, XEM holders who opted for the XYM snapshot received XYM tokens equivalent to the XEM in their wallet.</p>



<p>The New Economy Movement (NEM ecosystem) has a vast use-case. While the NEM.io Foundation has achieved some collaborations, more adoption can still happen on the network. Adoptions, upgrades, and increases in usage are crucial to the value of XEM. Thus, XEM is a coin of the future, and it has high real-world backing. Holding XEM will be a profitable investment in 2021 and the long-term. You can manage XEM tokens using the Atomic Wallet mobile app.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-buy-nem"><strong>How to Buy NEM</strong></h2>



<p>After creating your wallet on the Atomic app, you can buy cryptocurrencies directly. Tap &#8220;BUY&#8221; in your wallet, and pay; you can pay instantly with a debit card. Payments are fast and stress-free. Temporarily, users cannot buy XEM tokens from Atomic Wallet. However, you can buy XEM from a cryptocurrency exchange and send it to your wallet. NEM is on various crypto exchanges, including top names like Binance, Upbit, OKEx, Hotbit, and many more.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-exchange-nem"><strong>How to Exchange NEM</strong></h2>



<p>Atomic Wallet users can always exchange XEM for other cryptocurrencies from their wallets. You can trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, and several others for XEM. Likewise, you can swap XEM for other coins at an excellent market rate. Ensure you download the Atomic Wallet app and create a decentralized wallet.</p>



<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>



<p>This NEM price prediction cannot be 100% accurate. However, it can give investors a clue about the investment opportunities cryptocurrencies have to offer. Before you buy a coin, please do further research and analysis.</p>



<h4 id="stellar-price-prediction-amp-forecast-2021"><strong>Stellar Price Prediction &amp; Forecast 2021</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Will Stellar (XLM) rise or fall in the 2021 calendar year?</strong></p>



<p>Stellar current price is $0.3990. It has a circulating supply of 22,571,070,030 (45% of its maximum 50 billion XLM supply). What Stellar news could drive its price in 2021? On March 2, 2021, Stellar announced the introduction of Horizon 2.0 on its Twitter page. According to the announcement, the latest development helps users deploy Horizon with fewer resources.</p>



<p>Additionally, the Grayscale Investments hedge fund has purchased a total of 35,855,625 XLM so far in 2021. This announcement is a massive one for Stellar because institutional investors are vital for any cryptocurrency value to improve. Thus, as 2021 goes by, we might see an enormous pump in Stellar price.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/THETA-PRICE-PREDICTION-2021-1918x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34491" ></figure>



<h2 id="what-is-theta"><strong>What is Theta?</strong></h2>



<p>Video streaming is all around us and in high demand. A good portion of internet bandwidth is now used to stream videos. This industry keeps growing and will only continue to grow in the coming years. However, the current centralized video streaming platforms have various inadequacies plunging their services. That is what Theta has come to solve.</p>



<p>Theta is a decentralized platform that is introducing video streaming and video content into the blockchain space. Theta has the vision to provide – Next-generation video delivery powered by everyone. Steve Chen, a co-founder of YouTube, who is also part of the Theta team, said:</p>



<p>&#8220;Theta&#8217;s innovation will disrupt today&#8217;s online video industry much like YouTube did to traditional videos back in 2005. One of our biggest challenges has been the high costs of delivering videos, and this is only getting bigger with higher quality video streams. I&#8217;m excited to be part of the next evolution of the streaming space.&#8221;</p>



<p>To achieve its vision of delivering seamless, high-quality streams up to HD and 4K resolutions at low cost, Theta is looking to bring everyone&#8217;s resources together. How? They plan to employ the unused storage and bandwidth of users on the network. Thus, there will be enough room for videos of very high resolutions while participants receive rewards for their contributions. As said, video streaming platforms like YouTube, Netflix, and Live.ly continue to grow. Major social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter even have live video options. However, these videos become blurry most times, especially in developing countries where internet service is poor.</p>



<p>Theta team is innovating a lasting solution for video delivery using distributed blockchain technology. Thus, Theta Labs have been able to build the first Decentralized Streaming Network. Theta Labs is the parent company in charge of the Theta blockchain. Jieyi Long and Mitch Liu co-founded Theta Labs in 2018. Jieyi Long has multiple experiences in gaming, virtual reality, design automation, and distributed systems. He also holds patents in virtual reality, video streaming, and blockchain technology. Likewise, Liu has multiple experiences in the entertainment industry, including co-founding THETA.tv. The very first decentralized application built on the Theta network is THETA.tv.</p>



<p>The Theta blockchain has two native tokens, Theta (THETA) and Theta Fuel (TFUEL). THETA exists as a governance token and, at launch in 2018, was a token on the ERC-20 network. Theta held a one-year-long private token sale which ended in 2018. The company was able to raise $20 million during the initial sale. However, Theta now runs its main net, and all THETA tokens use the network.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Theta Fuel (TFUEL) powers the internal economy of the Theta blockchain. The Theta blockchain uses the Proof-of-Stake financial incentive scheme to ensure its users participate in governance activities. This way, the network is secured by participants and holders of the Theta token. Also, the blockchain utilizes the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) mechanism to balance its security. The multi-level BFT also ensures faster transactions, and the network can process up to 1000 transactions per second.</p>



<p>To easily calculate user engagement with live videos, the network relies on the Proof-of-Engagement protocol. This protocol provides transparent reports of users who have watched a video and rewards them. Hence, advertisers, creators, and viewers can efficiently measure their video streaming engagement.</p>



<h2 id="theta-price-chart"><strong>Theta Price Chart</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="720"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Theta-Price-Chart.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34484" ></figure>



<p>Theta has existed since 2018. However, it became tradable on Binance in April 2019. At that time, Theta coin price was $0.135 before dumping below 10 cents a month after Binance&#8217;s listing. It was able to recover and kept on increasing in price. Theta&#8217;s current price is $4.30, and its all-time high is $4.8. In March 2020, Theta price USD was 0.03977, and this price is the coin&#8217;s all-time low. Theta coin price is still on the rise, and possibly, it will continue to reach new all-time highs.</p>



<h2 id="market-prediction-for-theta-theta-price-2021"><strong>Market Prediction for Theta (THETA) Price 2021</strong></h2>



<p>Theta&#8217;s current price, like other cryptocurrencies, is moving with the current market trend. Its all-time high is a recent price, so we may continue to have more highs if the market proves bullish. Going back, Theta price as of January 2018 was around $0.2, and it did drop significantly to as low as $0.039. However, since the Binance listing, Theta coin price continues to climb higher. Stats from various Theta news shows that the Theta project has a substantial audience in the cryptocurrency market. Theta ranks 18 among over 8,700 on the list of cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap. According to Theta&#8217;s current price chart, the coin has formed support levels at $1.84 and $2.85. Since 2021, the Theta coin price has not broken any of these pivot points.</p>



<p>Currently, Theta&#8217;s market capitalization and fully diluted cap are $4,301,936,592. THETA&#8217;s daily trading volume is over $190 million, and more than 90,000 traders have it on their watchlist. THETA coin has a circulating supply, total and maximum supply of 1 billion (1,000,000,000) tokens. THETA serves as a governance token and is distributed among the Theta network participants, including the Theta team. The Theta network also powers decentralized applications on its smart contract platform. However, developers power transactions using Theta Fuel (TFUEL). TFUEL is another token of Theta with a 5 billion total supply.</p>



<h2 id="theta-predictions-2021"><strong>Theta Predictions 2021</strong></h2>



<p>Will Theta grow or decrease in 2021? Let us discuss some expert Theta predictions.</p>



<h3 id="digital-coin-price-theta-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Digital-Coin-Price Theta Price Prediction 2021</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="720"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Digital-Coin-Price-Theta-Price-Prediction-20210A.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34485" ></figure>



<p>Digital Coin experts predict that the Theta coin price will hit $7 by 2021. Also, they endorsed the THETA coin as a profitable investment in 2021. Their THETA value speculation is about 2x of Theta&#8217;s current price. This forecast is a very realistic one as altcoins rally in price, especially during a bull run.</p>



<h3 id="wallet-investor-theta-predictions-for-2021"><strong>Wallet Investor Theta Predictions for 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Walletinvestor.com currently marks the Theta coin as an excellent investment for one year.

<h3 id="coin-bureau-theta-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Coin Bureau Theta Price Prediction 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Expert YouTube crypto-analysis channel, Coin Bureau, has given a detailed analysis of factors that will cause a pump in Theta price. He stated his viewpoint in a video made in December 2020 about the potential of Theta network&#8217;s THETA and TFUEL. According to Coin Bureau, TFUEL currently has a 5 billion token supply, but the figure is inflationary. Also, TFUEL serves as a means of payment on the blockchain, so buying pressure could keep its price down. However, THETA has a fixed non-inflationary supply with a solid use-case. Thus, THETA price has a strong bullish potential in 2021 more than TFUEL. Coin Bureau did not give a specific Theta price prediction in his video.</p>

<h3 id="previsioni-bitcoin-theta-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Previsioni Bitcoin Theta Price Prediction 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Previsionibitcoin.com is an expert price prediction website for cryptocurrencies. Previsioni Bitcoin predicts that the Theta coin price will be almost $11 by December 2021. They base this heavy boost in Theta price on the coin&#8217;s use-case. According to Previsioni Bitcoin, the Theta network and its token will receive massive attention to boost Theta news. Thus, in 2021, Theta&#8217;s value will grow more, and its capitalization will consequently increase. Of course, a coin for the very first blockchain-based video streaming platform has a strong potential.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="720"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Previsioni-Bitcoin-Theta-Price-Prediction-20210A.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34489" ></figure>



<h2 id="theta-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Theta Price Prediction 2021</strong></h2>



<p>The blockchain-based video streaming platform has some big plans to execute in the 2021 calendar year. Theta news includes some impressive roadmap the company has for 2021:</p>



<ul><li>&nbsp;The launch of a decentralized exchange on the Theta network in quarter one of 2021</li><li>&nbsp;Launch of Theta mainnet 3.0 in quarter two</li><li>&nbsp;Theta official app for Ledger and Trezor wallet also in Q2 of 2021</li><li>&nbsp;Release of Version 2 of the Edgecast Decentralized Streaming App (Dapp) – Q3 2021</li><li>&nbsp;Version 2 of the Advanced Smart Contract Developer – Q4 2021</li></ul>



<p>Theta co-founder Mitch Liu also laid out another plan for this year – the Edgecast Node platform. This platform will deliver local ingest and encoding of streams, fully decentralized streaming, chat, and event notifications. Similarly, Theta Edgecast will be the world&#8217;s first decentralized streaming Dapp for end-to-end live streaming and video delivery. According to Liu, there is a rapid growth in Theta.tv and the native cryptocurrencies of the Theta network.</p>



<p>Another exciting announcement from Theta news is the Google Chrome extension for Theta Wallet. This update is a substantial achievement because Theta has just partnered with the world&#8217;s biggest search engine. By April 20, Theta is expected to launch the THETA MAINNET 3.0, which in their roadmap is set for Q2 of 2021. This new network upgrade will introduce TFuel staking and uptime mining and burning. Participants who want to stake TFUEL will have to download the THETA Edge Node.</p>



<p>Announcements, upgrades, and improvements like these are enough to make THETA price skyrocket in 2021. Theta news is impressive, and this is enough to excite investors. No wonder THETA is on over 90,000 watchlists on CoinMarketCap. Theta is a promising blockchain project, and Theta coin price may go beyond expectations in 2021.</p>



<h2 id="theta-price-prediction-2025"><strong>Theta Price Prediction 2025</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="720"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Theta-Price-Prediction-20250A.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34490" ></figure>



<p>For all crypto assets, 2025 is still a long way. A year ago, Bitcoin&#8217;s price was much less than $10,000. However, it recently hit over $57,000 in February. Theta could do the same in the long run as a result of its unending use-case. Remember, the video streaming industry is predicted to grow immensely, especially in the coming years. So, a decentralized and low-cost video streamer like Theta will also follow the growth trend.</p>



<p>Expert prediction websites like Digital Coin are as well bullish on the long-term price of Theta. According to the Digital-coin-price algorithm, Theta price by 2025 will be up to $12 and even more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As above, Wallet Investor is also very bullish on Theta price USD future price. They provide a five-year forecast of up to a 440% increase in Theta&#8217;s current price. Thus, a $1,000 investment from now will yield a $4,400 profit by 2025. These Theta predictions are achievable by 2025.</p>



<h2 id="theta-price-prediction-verdict"><strong>Theta Price Prediction Verdict</strong></h2>



<p>The Theta project is worth the hype. Theta Labs and the team have been able to achieve meaningful partnerships. From 2018 till now, Theta is only three years old. Many cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects have been existing before Theta. However, Theta leads some of these projects in use-case, real-world usage, partnership, and coin price. Also, there is some interesting Theta news worth discussing. In December 2020, Theta started to introduce smart contracts to their Mainnet. From January 2021, Theta has added three new partnerships, including:</p>



<ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>WorldPokerTour.com</strong>&nbsp;– WorldPokerTour integrated Theta Network to launch an exclusive channel powered by Theta.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Lionsgate:</strong>&nbsp;On February 11, Theta announced that famous Hollywood filmmaking studio Lionsgate introduces its contents to Theta Network.</li><li>&nbsp;<strong>Sony Europe</strong>&nbsp;– In March 2021, Sony Europe joined the Theta Enterprise Validator program. Existing Enterprise Validator Nodes were Samsung, Google, Binance, Gumi, and Blockchain.com.</li></ul>



<p>Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of the first digital asset and cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, wanted to decentralize money and finance in general, and it was a success. Founders of Theta want to decentralize video streaming and entertainment and are becoming successful. In the next few years, when Theta fully decentralizes video streaming, Will THETA become the next Bitcoin and TFUEL the next Ethereum? The answer is only subject to time. Theta is a promising cryptocurrency, and Theta&#8217;s value might be set for new highs in the nearest future. If you find Theta a worthy crypto investment in 2021, you can manage Theta on the Atomic Wallet app.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-neo">What is Neo?</h2>



<p>Neo is an enterprise-ready and community-driven network for the innovative economy.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/neo-wallet" rel="noreferrer noopener">NEO</a>&nbsp;is often referred to as the &#8220;Ethereum of China.&#8221; It is an open-source blockchain project that provides public blockchain services to developers and cryptocurrency investors. Translating the word Neo to Greek, it means &#8221;new&#8221;. Thus, Neo could be the more recent version of Ethereum developed in China. To set itself aside from Ethereum, Neo uses digital identity to digitize assets. Neo achieves digitization of items by creating a virtual or digital avatar for physical assets registered on its network. This avatar will have the same worth as the physical item it represents. The Neo blockchain was the first China-developed blockchain to receive approval from Chinese regulators. NEO is very flexible with its network language. Unlike Ethereum that only supports Solidity, Neo supports mainstream languages, including C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, Go, and (JS/TS).</p>



<p>Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang are the co-founders of this open network for the innovative economy. Da Hongfei is a graduate of the South Chinese University of Technology and a blockchain enthusiast. Erik Zhang, who is the brain behind the dBFT protocol, is a graduate of Shanghai University. Hongfei and Zhang founded NEO in February 2014. Meanwhile, the project was then known as Antshares with a token name of Antcoins (ANC). The team released NEO&#8217;sNEO&#8217;s whitepaper in April 2016, stating the project&#8217;s goals, development roadmap, and the technology they will utilize. The whitepaper stated the features and benefits of the Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) mechanism. Since dBFT was the first-ever consensus mechanism created in China, NEO news had massive media coverage then. In August 2016, there was an initial coin offering for NEO. The project secured over $4.5 million from the token sale—Neo Foundation better-funded Neo&#8217;sNeo&#8217;s strategies after the ICO. NEO received support from the US crypto market in 2017 after rebranding from Antshares. Bittrex listed NEO on its exchange, and a year after that, VALID also partnered with NEO. VALID is a digital identity management platform, thereby giving NEO&#8217;sNEO&#8217;s digital asset use-case a real-word usage.</p>



<p>The NEO network hosts two native tokens NEO and NEO GAS (or GAS). NEO is an investment token that also gives governance and voting rights to people who hold it. NEO GAS is a means of payment on the network; developers or businesses who create products on the blockchain pay transaction fees using GAS before they successfully launch a project.</p>



<p>NEO runs its unique consensus mechanism; the network validates transactions using the delegated Byzantine Fault Mechanism (dBFT). Distributed blockchains systems face the threat of transmission errors, network latency, and other loopholes in their security. Also, data differences and dishonest nodes may emerge on the network. While the proof-of-work protocol tries to solve these issues, PoW is rather expensive. Electricity and computational cost are enormous, likewise the need for stable internet connection. As a result, NEO proposes the delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance. This algorithm is based on the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance.</p>



<p>Per dBFT, some nodes are known as Bookkeepers, or digital accountants do the block verifications. Afterward, they broadcast the data on the blockchain. To reach a consensus, two-thirds of network nodes must agree on the new block. Advantages to this consensus mechanism are numerous. Meanwhile, the dBFT facilitates super-fast transactions up to 1,000 TPS (transactions per second).</p>



<p>In comparison, Ethereum can only handle about 12 to 15 transactions every second. Additionally, the Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance does not require computational and electricity costs like Proof-of-Work. Furthermore, the dBFT protocol helps to prevent dishonest nodes from undermining the blockchain&#8217;s efficiency.</p>



<p>In 2014, Hongfei and Zhang also worked on a blockchain project known as Onchain. Onchain is a blockchain network that provides private blockchain services for various businesses. Onchain uses the Distributed Networks Architecture (DNA) to help companies to create private blockchain networks.</p>

<p>NEO began 2021 with an uptrend. Remember, as of March 2020, the NEO coin price fell below $4, and the highest it sold for in 2020 was $26. NEO price was around $14 when the coin formed a demand candle at the beginning of 2021. Since then, the lowest NEO price USD has been $14. In 2021, the NEO price chart formed a resistance level at $55 (NEO&#8217;sNEO&#8217;s highest price in 2021 so far) and another price resistance around $43 on the daily timeframe. On the daily timeframe, Pivot support levels on NEO&#8217;s current price chart are at $43 and another at $20. In 2018, NEO was part of the massive bull run. NEO coin price went as high as $196.85, which is NEO&#8217;sNEO&#8217;s all-time high.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, NEO&#8217;sNEO&#8217;s all-time low is $0.0722. So far, $0.0722 has been NEO&#8217;sNEO&#8217;s lowest price for the past four years. The all-time low was NEO value in its early days. NEO&#8217;s current price as of this write-up is $38.45. Possibly, this price is a result of Bitcoin price dumping from $61,000 to $55,000.</p>



<h2 id="market-prediction-for-neo-in-2021">Market Prediction for NEO in 2021</h2>



<p>The growing ecosystem of Neo owns a unique native token. Neo coin is reputable and well known in the crypto space, and it ranks 38 on CoinMarketCap. Out of almost 8,800 cryptocurrencies, Neo claims 0.16% of the total market cap of crypto assets. Neo has a market capitalization of over $2.7 billion ($2,712,477,055). Likewise, Neo boasts of a daily trading volume of more than $700 million. Thus, Neo is no micro-cap asset that can be subject to pump and dump schemes.</p>



<p>The NEO coin has a definite maximum supply. The max amount of NEO that will ever be available is 100 million tokens. Meanwhile, the amount of NEO in circulation is 70,538,831. If the maximum supply of NEO were to be in circulation, then its market capitalization would be $3,845,367,177 (going by Neo value). Over 133,000 CoinMarketCap customers have NEO on their watchlists. NEO is tradable on significant cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, Huobi, Bitfinex, Kucoin, and many others.</p>



<h2 id="neo-price-prediction-2021">Neo Price Prediction 2021</h2>



<h3 id="longforecast-neo-price-prediction-2021">Longforecast Neo Price Prediction 2021</h3>



<p>Throughout 2021, Longforecast predicts that Neo would not close at a $60 coin price. Although NEO price could go above $60, it will later fall below that mark. Neo predictions by Longforecast.com are that the coin would close around $58 by December 2021. Also, their future Neo predictions suggest that Neo value will continue to dump even in the long-term.</p>

<p>While Wallet Investor does not predict a bearish 2021 for Neo, they do not see a massive rise in NEO price this year. Wallet Investor marks NEO as an excellent cryptocurrency to hold for one year. According to Walletinvestor.com, the price forecast for Neo within a year is $44.59. Therefore, if you buy at Neo&#8217;s current price, every token you buy would yield $5 after a year.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="720"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wallet-Investor-Neo-Price-Prediction-for-20210A.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34450"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wallet-Investor-Neo-Price-Prediction-for-20210A.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wallet-Investor-Neo-Price-Prediction-for-20210A.png 910w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wallet-Investor-Neo-Price-Prediction-for-20210A.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wallet-Investor-Neo-Price-Prediction-for-20210A.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wallet-Investor-Neo-Price-Prediction-for-20210A.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wallet-Investor-Neo-Price-Prediction-for-20210A.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wallet-Investor-Neo-Price-Prediction-for-20210A.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wallet-Investor-Neo-Price-Prediction-for-20210A.png 1280w"  sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" ></figure>



<p>Additionally, Wallet Investor predicts that Neo would sell for up to $68.68 by 2026. Thus, buying $1,000 worth of Neo tokens will yield $736 profit within five-years.</p>



<h2 id="neo-price-prediction-2021-2">Neo Price Prediction 2021</h2>



<p>The 2021 calendar year is still in its first quarter. So, Neo can achieve so much from now till December. Several factors could drive Neo&#8217;s price to new highs in 2021. To avoid inflation, Neo only mines 15 million of its tokens per year. This way, if some interesting Neo news causes an increase in demand, the market won&#8217;t have to battle with supply. Also, Neo can process up to 1,000 transactions every second. Thus, the blockchain is enterprise-ready and can enable massive adoption. Firms such as Microsoft, HyperLedger, and Alibaba are investors in the Neo project. The founders of NEO are keen on gaining recognition and cooperation from the Chinese government. If this happens, Neo would be able to receive large investors from the Chinese financial market.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, there are downsides to the several advantages of Neo. As said, the founders of Neo have another project called Onchain. While Onchain serves another purpose different from Neo, its policy might have effects on Neo. Also, if Onchain seems to gain better support and partnerships, there is a possibility that the co-founders could divert their attention from Neo. Although, it might be hard to abandon Neo since it is as promising as Onchain.</p>



<p>Every month, Neo releases a statement reporting the activities of the team and developers. The report for February 2021 stated that the proposed Neo3 would soon be ready for a formal TestNet launch. The latest development about Neo3 is Preview5. This feature will introduce a domain name service compatible with traditional IP domain names &#8211; thereby making the Neo platform more user-friendly. The report stated that Neo3 TestNet should be ready to launch by late March 2021. The upgrade into Neo3 is expected to be great Neo news, which could drive Neo coin price higher.</p>



<h2 id="neo-price-prediction-2025">Neo Price Prediction 2025</h2>



<p>Neo Predictions for 2025 are both positive and negative. As it should be, some expert prediction websites predict that Neo&#8217;s price will be more than double in 2025. However, some websites forecast that there will be no massive improvement in Neo&#8217;s current price in the long-term.</p>



<p>Wallet Investor predicts that Neo will hit almost $90 by 2025. They gave a specific prediction of $68.68 Neo coin price.</p>



<p>Longforecast.com is relatively neutral on their future price forecast for Neo. Longforecast experts predict that Neo price USD will be between $39-$46 by 2025.</p>



<p>Digital Coin also has a bullish Neo price prediction. By 2025, they speculate that Neo coin price would be about 3x its current price.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="720"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Neo-Price-Prediction-20250A.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34451"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Neo-Price-Prediction-20250A.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Neo-Price-Prediction-20250A.png 910w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Neo-Price-Prediction-20250A.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Neo-Price-Prediction-20250A.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Neo-Price-Prediction-20250A.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Neo-Price-Prediction-20250A.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Neo-Price-Prediction-20250A.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Neo-Price-Prediction-20250A.png 1280w"  sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" ></figure>



<p>Price Predictions for such a long-term can be challenging. However, as the available cryptocurrency market cap is moving towards $2 trillion, the price of crypto assets will follow the trend since they determine the market&#8217;s total value.</p>



<h2 id="neo-price-prediction-verdict">Neo Price Prediction Verdict</h2>



<p>Neo is a thriving network that is rapidly growing and developing. The Neo Foundation, formerly known as Neo Council, has secure partnerships for the blockchain service. Also, decentralized applications, smart contracts, and other exciting products are emerging on the network. Developments like these will enable Neo to reach its goal to become the next-generation internet.</p>



<p>Recently, NEO announced its partnership with the upcoming DigiFinex Cryptocurrency debit card. This card will provide customers with the ability to make payments with NEO and other cryptocurrencies through UnionPay. This development is to launch on March 30, 2021. Meanwhile, UnionPay is one of the world&#8217;s largest PIN-network.</p>



<p>Likewise, on March 15, FiCAS ETP, a firm that trades on the Swiss SIX Exchange, received the visit of a representative of the Neo Blockchain.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VECHAIN-PRICE-PREDICTION-2021-1918x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34440" ></figure>



<h2 id="what-is-vechain-vet"><strong>What is VeChain (VET)?</strong></h2>



<p>VeChain is a blockchain establishment that aims to strike a balance between centralization and decentralization. VeChain has a goal to efficiently and transparently decentralize supply-chains of businesses. Over time, trained professionals have been handling supply-chain management and then giving reports to companies. However, some of these professionals become corrupt and fraudulent, especially when dealing with luxury goods. As a result, counterfeit items have cost the luxury industry billions of dollars. Hence, the founders of VeChain deem it fit to adopt the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for tracking the supply of goods. Each product is given a unique identity using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). Smart chips on each item will record whatever happens throughout the supply chain. Afterward, the RFID will publish this information to the blockchain platform, and authorized individuals can access it.</p>



<p>Sunny Lu and Jay Zhang co-founded VeChain back in 2015 before the service became official in 2016. Sunny Lu was the Chief Information Officer (CIO) of Louis Vuitton China before he started VeChain. Louis Vuitton is a fashion brand that majorly produces expensive clothing. No wonder Lu was inspired to launch a blockchain network that aims to solve the problems of supply-chain. The company began as a subsidiary of Bitse, a prominent blockchain company in China. In 2017, VeChain held a crowd sale for its cryptocurrency (known as VEN by then) as a token on the Ethereum blockchain. Back then, Vechain used to operate as VEN, and its cryptocurrency was the VEN token. VeChain sold one billion VEN tokens during the distribution, and this amounted to $20 million. The VeChain Foundation operates the VeChain ecosystem and VeChainThor blockchain. The Foundation ensures transparency within the ecosystem.</p>



<p>VeChain rebranded from VEN in 2018 and started its VeChainThor (VET) blockchain. Consequently, VET tokens replaced VEN, and the team had to import all tokens to the VeChainThor blockchain at a 1:100 ratio. Currently, the VeChainThor blockchain hosts two native cryptocurrencies – VET and VTHO. VET is the cryptocurrency that powers the network and is for sending, staking, and holding. Meanwhile, VTHO serves as means by which businesses pay to build decentralized applications on the Vechain network.</p>



<p>VET has a fixed supply, and its price is subject to demand. However, to ensure that developers and businesses pay stable network fees, VTHO supply is occasionally adjusted to sustain a stable price. Also, in case of a wrong transaction fee estimate, the blockchain provides a Proof of Work option. Thus, developers can mine more VTHO to pay their fees.</p>



<p>Several blockchains have come up with new governance protocols different from Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-stake. Vechain is not left behind. The VeChainThor blockchain adopts a unique consensus mechanism known as Proof of Authority (PoA). Per proof-of-authority, participants hold governance and voting rights based on how many VET tokens they hold. There are 101 Authority Masternodes that verify transactions on the blockchain. Authority Masternodes include enterprise users, academic research partners, community contributors, and other stakeholders. These stakeholders must hold a minimum of 25 million VET tokens. Moreover, the VeChain Foundation has to verify participants who wish to become Masternodes.</p>



<p>VET holders can also obtain voting rights. Although, they need to hold at least 1 million VET tokens. Participants who have verified their know-your-customer (KYC) credentials have 30% voting power. However, unverified individuals with up to 1 million VET coins only receive 20% voting rights. VeChain wants to bring transparency into supply-chain management; thus, it has to ensure transparency in its system. Thus, there are no anonymous nodes in the VeChainThor network.</p>



<p>Per VeChain&#8217;s goal, the proof-of-authority mechanism is an excellent choice. It does not require computational power, neither does it need a lot of confirmations. However, there are shortcomings to the protocol VeChain runs. For example, proof of authority does not retain absolute decentralization. There is a need for verification of participants on the network. Also, power is centralized to individuals who hold a large chunk of VET tokens.</p>

<p>After the initial coin offering of 2017, Binance listed Vechain in July 2017. The VeChain price during the Binance listing was around $0.025. It didn&#8217;t maintain this price as it fell below $0.01 in August 2018. Since then, VET price has been crawling, and not until January 2021 did it hit $0.025 (Price as at Binance listing) again. As of this writing, the VET price was at its peak, with an all-time high of $0.072 on March 12, 2020. Thus, VeChain&#8217;s current price could be its all-time high as the coin seems to be experiencing an uptrend. A year ago, on March 13, 2020, the VeChain coin price dumped to $0.00168, which is its all-time low. VeChain&#8217;s current price during this write-up is $0.07.</p>



<h2 id="market-prediction-for-vechain-vet-2021"><strong>Market Prediction for VeChain (VET) 2021</strong></h2>



<p>On the daily time frame, VeChain&#8217;s current price chart has formed price support around $0.0376, $0.024, and $0.01. Meanwhile, the $0.0376 and $0.024 support are very recent price levels that VeChain price formed in 2021. VeChain coin price continues to sustain the $0.01 support level since 2020. The movement of the general cryptocurrency market is significant to determine where VeChain coin price is heading. Also, BTC dominance is essential as it claims more than 60% of the total market. Thus, a slight movement in BTC price can reverse the market trend at any time.</p>



<p>VeChain is a popular crypto asset. It ranks 20 on the list of almost 8,800 cryptocurrencies. Also, VeChain is a coin on over 200,000 watchlists on CoinMarketCap. VeChain has a maximum and total supply of 86,712,634,446. The circulating supply of VET is 64,315,576,989 (74% of its max amount). While VET has a specific maximum, its circulating supply will increase as VeChain news sees more adoption. VET has a market capitalization of over $4 billion. Meanwhile, going by VeChain current price and its maximum supply, VET has a diluted market cap of $5,978,653,300. However, the fully diluted market cap is subject to a price change, while the market cap is subject to movement in price and an increase in circulating amount.</p>



<p>Currently, VeChain has a daily trading volume of over $1.1 billion. Thus, VET is not a micro-cap coin, and it has a strong base in the cryptocurrency market. Remember, the VeChainThor blockchain has two native tokens. These in-house tokens are VET and VTHO (VeChainThor Energy). VET has a fixed supply. However, we cannot determine the maximum amount of VTHO due to the purpose it serves on the network. By staking VET, investors can generate some income in VTHO. However, to avoid an infinity supply, 70% of VTHO paid in transaction fees is frequently burnt.</p>

<h3 id="digital-coin-price-vechain-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Digital-Coin-Price VeChain Price Prediction 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Digital Coin prediction website is not very bullish on their VeChain price prediction. Their VeChain price prediction for December 2021 is $0.095. This forecast is just about a $0.03 increase from VeChain current price. Meanwhile, Digital-Coin-Price also predicts that VeChain price USD would reach $0.109 by August 2021 before it dumps to their December prediction.</p>

<p>Trading Beasts VeChain predictions for 2021 are as well neutral. Experts of this price prediction website do not foresee a massive increase in VET price this year. The average price prediction they have for December 2021 is $0.087. However, the maximum price they predict for VeChain in 2021 is attractive. From April to December, Tradingbeasts.com predicts that VeChain will have a maximum price of up to $0.01.</p>

<p>Wallet Investor marks VET as an excellent or profitable one-year investment. Their one-year VeChain price prediction is $0.09. Meanwhile, Wallet Investor is very bullish on their long-term VeChain predictions. According to tradingbeasts.com, VET prices will increase by over 260% in the next five years. Thus, investing $1,000 in VeChain now will yield more than $2,000 by 2026.</p>

<p>While Wallet Investor&#8217;s prediction is not very bullish for this year, their VeChain current price indicator shows that bulls have taken control of the VeChain market. Thus, selling pressure could take over anytime.</p>



<h3 id="bitboy-crypto-vechain-predictions-for-2021"><strong>BitBoy Crypto VeChain Predictions for 2021</strong></h3>



<p>In a YouTube video of February 2021, BitBoy stated why we could experience 20 times VeChain current price in 2021. His analysis was majorly fundamental, and it is based on VeChain&#8217;s use-case and partnerships. The YouTube crypto analyst expressed his belief in VeChain as a network with almost no competitor within the blockchain space. As VeChain aims to change the future of logistics, the team is organizing partnerships, expanding in China and even to the West. Likewise, the VET token is growing to become a payment solution for the supply chain management.</p>

<p>Mind Math is an expert YouTube crypto analyst. His VeChain price prediction was based on technical analysis of previous VET price action. He stated pivot resistance levels around $0.06 before VET crashed by 40% and now is regaining strength. Meanwhile, he also marked support points on the daily timeframe around $0.4. Mind Maths pointed out various technical factors which might be crucial to determine VET price movement in 2021. However, he didn&#8217;t give a definite VeChain value prediction.</p>

<h2 id="vechain-price-prediction-2021"><strong>VeChain Price Prediction 2021</strong></h2>



<p>As above, VeChain is a project with practical usage. VeChainThor is a public blockchain that derives value from projects its members create. Thus, developers who build decentralized applications on the VeChainThor network add to VeChain value. To promote VeChainThor, VeChain Foundation has set up programs to educate developers about the network. Examples of these resources are:</p>



<ul><li>&nbsp;Lively Boot Camp for the VeChain community</li><li>Application Hub – where VeChainThor users can explore the information on the blockchain</li><li>A Developer Info Center – here programmers can find documents and guides to develop Dapps</li><li>Bounty Programs where projects built on the blockchain receive support from the VeChain community</li><li>VeResearch – this includes VeChiain&#8217;s research and academic papers. Likewise, their published technical write-ups.</li><li>VeVote – users and nodes vote on solutions to ensure the VeChainThor blockchain remains anonymous and impossible to manipulate.</li></ul>



<p>While VeChain might have a reasonable use-case for its project, it is uncertain that many businesses will buy into their idea. Installing and managing RFID tags, smart chips, and other supply chain management devices might be expensive. As a result, companies that move a tremendous amount of goods will find it hard to pay for the items and labor costs. If VeChain cannot decentralize information within the supply chain, this could cause a hard time for VET value.</p>



<p>Within 2021 it is possible to see a reasonable spike in VET price. The VeChain Foundation is doing its best to achieve publicity for the project. Also, VeChainThor is a solution-based blockchain and not just a way to decentralize money. Like VeChain predictions of expert websites, VeChain price USD could reach $0.1. However, this prediction might be subject to general movements of the crypto market and Bitcoin price.</p>



<h2 id="vechain-price-prediction-2025"><strong>VeChain Price Prediction 2025</strong></h2>



<p>VeChain does not limit itself to the blockchain space. As the world continues to embrace technology and easier ways of doing things, VeChain will not be left behind. If VeChain targets developing markets like Africa, investors could find their supply chain concept interesting. Remember, Africans are gradually adopting the blockchain idea, especially to escape inflation of their currencies. VeChain value could reach one dollar or more by 2025 if it sustains more partnerships and product launches on VeChainThor.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, expert prediction sites like Digital coin predicted that VeChain price USD would only reach $0.2 by 2025.</p>



<p>Likewise, Wallet Investor predicts that VeChain price USD would be up to $0.24 by 2026. This forecast is a feasible prediction for the next five years.</p>



<h2 id="vechain-price-prediction-verdict"><strong>VeChain Price Prediction Verdict</strong></h2>



<p>VET has a lot of fundamental backings. As a Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) network, VeChainThor is pushing adoption and encouraging product launch because it is vital to any blockchain. If the team can secure as many products on the network, they can be sure of investments that will trigger VeChain value. According to VeChain news on their official blog, VeChain has secured numerous partnerships and is open for more.</p>



<p>Recently, PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC), an accounting and business advisory firm, bought shares in VeChain. PwC is looking to integrate the VeChain module to deliver a trust-free service within the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem.</p>



<p>Similarly, Vechain partnered with Jiangsu Electronics, a Chinese Company. The company will develop RFID chips that will ensure proper tracking of supply chain information.</p>



<p>Likewise, car producers like Renault have integrated VeChain for their manufacturing operations. BMW also uses VeChain to prevent odometer fraud in sales of its cars.</p>



<p>Moreover, Walmart China currently uses VeChain&#8217;s technology to ensure the safety of food during transit.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Renji Hospital in China also announced its plan to launch the world&#8217;s first Intelligent Tumor Treatment Center in October 2020. The medical management solution will be based on VeChain&#8217;s blockchain network.</p>



<p>Within and beyond blockchain, VeChain news is being spread wide. VeChain is the first five-star company to receive the TUV Saar Blockchain Service Certification. VeChainThor might still be in its early days of adoption and development. Therefore, VeChain value in 2021 and coming years will be mind-blowing. Investors who wish to add VET to their cryptocurrency portfolio can do that on Atomic Wallet.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-iota-miota"><strong>What is IOTA (MIOTA)?</strong></h2>



<p>IOTA is a cryptocurrency project that does not run on a blockchain. Instead, IOTA uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure which they call Tangle. IOTA aims to develop a mode of communication within the&nbsp;<strong>Internet of Things&nbsp;</strong>(IoT) ecosystem. IOTA uses the Tangle mechanism to store and process transactions for free. Free in the sense that it can successfully process microtransactions. Remember, a setback of the Bitcoin network is that it cannot process micro-transactions due to transaction fees. Bitcoin has to pay miners who confirm transactions on the blockchain. However, all MIOTA tokens have been pre-mined. Pre-mining of MIOTA coins could have as well caused an increase in transaction fees. However, IOTA uses the Tangle mechanism to confirm transactions.</p>



<p>IOTA solves scalability problems by forcing a transaction issuer to approve two previous transactions. What does this mean? If user C wants to transfer some MIOTA tokens, he can confirm users A and B&#8217;s transactions. So, when next A and B wants to make a MIOTA payment, they have to validate two other transactions. Hence, no miners confirm transactions, and there is no need for high transaction fees. Due to the increase in use, some blockchains like<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/bitcoin-scaling-problem-explained" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Bitcoin</a>&nbsp;might develop congestion and become slower. However, the kind of mechanism Tangle will require more and more users. Thus, this protocol can help solve the congestion issues that blockchains might soon develop.</p>



<p>IOTA dates back to 2014 but was known as the Jinn project then. It was a hardware project that intends to produce general-purpose processors that are less expensive. In September 2014, there was a crowd sale for the Jinn token where the ICO sold out 100,000 coins. However, Jinn rebranded to IOTA in 2015. Co-founders of IOTA are Serguei Popov, Dominik Schiener, Sergey Ivancheglo and David Sønstebø. IOTA Foundation is a non-profit organization in charge of the IOTA project. The IOTA foundation is based in Germany and works to extend utility for the MIOTA token.</p>

<h2 id="market-prediction-for-miota-price-2021"><strong>Market Prediction for MIOTA Price 2021</strong></h2>



<p>Since July 2018, MIOTA&#8217;s price has fallen below $1, and it closed around $0.31 in 2020. However, in February 2021, the IOTA price increased to $1 once again. IOTA&#8217;s current price is $1.12 with a trading volume of over $149 million. Its current market capitalization is $3,113,286,900 and it ranks 25 on CoinMarketCap. IOTA has a circulating supply of 2,779,530,283. As said, all IOTA coins have been pre-mined. As a result, its maximum supply is the same as its circulating supply (2,779,530,283 MIOTA tokens). You can trade IOTA on top cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, OKEx, HitBTC, and Upbit.</p>



<p>Three years ago, the IOTA coin price had an all-time high of $5.69. However, in March 2020, MIOTA&#8217;s price dropped drastically to $0.0796. What a massive dump in price! Meanwhile, it was quick to recover as IOTA price USD is now above $1. Currently, the IOTA price support level lay around $0.8. However, market volatility might break this support level.</p>

<p>IOTA has a good potential and an excellent use-case in the Internet of Things ecosystem. However, expert IOTA predictions and algorithm forecasts about IOTA value might differ. Let us review some IOTA news for 2021.</p>



<h3 id="martin-palamarz-iota-predictions-2021"><strong>Martin Palamarz IOTA Predictions 2021</strong></h3>



<p>While replying to Elon Musk&#8217;s tweet, Martin Palamarz expressed his belief in IOTA. Palamarz said blockchain had caused a trilemma due to lack of scalability and cost of transactions. However, what IOTA is designing will soon solve these issues. IOTA will deliver free payments and the most decentralized DLT.</p>



<p>&#8220;The thing we call money is just an information system for labor allocation,&#8221; Elon Musk, CEO Tesla.</p>



<p>Martin Palamarz thinks Elon Musk should look out for IOTA and invest in the project.</p>

<h3 id="digital-coin-price-iota-predictions-2021"><strong>Digital-Coin-Price IOTA Predictions 2021</strong></h3>



<p>IOTA predictions on the Digital Coin Price website are quite realistic. By December, Digital Coin forecast IOTA value to be around $1.8. Meanwhile, in May and August 2021, the IOTA price will be higher than its price in December. Due to market instabilities, this price prediction is feasible, and IOTA price USD might not reach $2 in 2021.</p>

<h2 id="iota-price-prediction-2021"><strong>IOTA Price Prediction 2021</strong></h2>



<p>The above IOTA predictions of expert websites all sit below $2 in 2021. Various events could positively or negatively affect IOTA price prediction. IOTA is looking to develop a real-world use-case for the MIOTA token. Thus, it has added some impressive partnerships to boost MIOTA&#8217;s adoption. Currently, IOTA is in collaboration with companies like Volkswagen, Samsung, and Cisco. It also wants to develop ID cards based on Tangle for people living in Taipei. The Internet of Things to which IOTA is directing its work is growing too. Expenditures in the IoT ecosystem should increase to over $260 by 2021. This adoption can boost IOTA value and also increase MIOTA price.</p>



<p>Other cryptocurrencies that run on blockchains are developing scalability problems due to adoption. However, IOTA uses Tangle technology, and Tangle&#8217;s design supports rapid growth in use. So, for MIOTA, adoption is not a problem. Real-world partnership, the Internet of Things, and scalability are blessings to IOTA value; what are its pitfalls?</p>



<p>IOTA&#8217;s technology, Tangle, is still a work in progress, and there are shortcomings in its development. For example, Tangle might not be able to record transactions in the correct order. Likewise, Tangle might be prone to the activities of hackers. Apart from Tangle&#8217;s problems, IOTA competitors like the IoT Chain also pose a threat to MIOTA price. Competitors might gain a stand in the market and claim IOTA&#8217;s audience. If this happens, the IOTA coin price might continue to struggle within the $1 range.</p>



<h2 id="iota-price-prediction-2025"><strong>IOTA Price Prediction 2025</strong></h2>



<p>Generally, there is a hype of the cryptocurrency market. This hype can also affect IOTA news positively. Billionaire investors, including Elon Musk, have developed an interest in crypto assets. Likewise, investment companies, hedge funds, and family offices are buying into crypto now. This development is good news not only for the crypto market at large but also for IOTA.</p>



<p>Major crypto prediction websites are bullish on IOTA price USD for the long-term. 2025 is still a long way for IOTA. Meanwhile, Digital Coin predicts that MIOTA price will be up to $3.75 in 2025.</p>



<h2 id="our-verdict-on-iota-price-prediction"><strong>Our Verdict on IOTA Price Prediction</strong></h2>



<p>On the IOTA price chart, its Relative Strength Index at the beginning of 2021 was 46.2. Meanwhile, its RSI kept increasing and became overbought towards the end of February. Currently, IOTA is technically indicating a buy position. However, its price is not growing by the day. Meanwhile, 2021 is still in its early days, and IOTA news might gain more attention in the market later.</p>



<p>As 2021 goes by, the IOTA price might improve due to its real-world use-case. Also, the IOTA Foundation has excellent partnerships and is working on more. If all these factors add up, MIOTA will be a coin of tremendous value. Thus, if you find the MIOTA token worth buying, you can manage it using the Atomic Wallet app.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-buy-iota"><strong>How to Buy IOTA</strong></h2>



<p>Atomic provides a cryptocurrency wallet with unique features. The Atomic Wallet supports over 500 cryptocurrencies and keeps your funds safe. You can always use Atomic to hold IOTA in 2021 or for the long-term. Meanwhile, you cannot buy MIOTA tokens on the Atomic wallet for now.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-tron-trx"><strong>What is Tron (TRX)</strong></h3>



<p>Tron is a cryptocurrency project that emphasizes eliminating the middlemen. Tron wants to DECENTRALIZE THE WEB. Meanwhile, Tron&#8217;s focus is not just on decentralizing finance and money. It aims to decentralize content-sharing and entertainment. No doubt, few entertainment giants centralize and control content distribution on the internet. These companies rake in massive revenue from adverts and consumer subscriptions. At the same time, they serve the content creators peanuts out of the income. Hence, Tron wants to build an ecosystem whereby content creators will enjoy direct and full compensation for their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tron runs an open blockchain network that has a distributed storage facility. Thus, it is efficient in storing content, and transactions are fast. Tronix (TRX) is the token for the Tron network. TRX serves as a means by which consumers pay content producers and developers. Developers can as well create their coins. However, this has to run on the Tron blockchain. Payment for content goes directly to producers&#8217; wallets, and thereby they receive full compensation for their work.</p>



<p>Tron is a project of the Tron Foundation. Tron Foundation is a Singapore-based non-profit entity that operates the Tron network. Tron Foundation has the responsibility to ensure transparency, openness, and fairness in Tron&#8217;s development. Justin Sun is the founder of the Tron Foundation and the brain behind Tron. Likewise, Sun is the founder of Peiwo, a live-streaming app. During the initial-coin-offering of TRX in 2017, Tron Foundation was able to raise $70 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="market-prediction-for-tron-trx-price-2021"><strong>Market prediction for Tron (TRX) price 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Tron&#8217;s current price has been very reluctant to go close to $0.1. Since it had a $0.3 all-time high in 2018, there has been no major Tron news. TRX price continues to consolidate around $0.01 and $0.06 since January 2020 to date. Why is there no better Tron news? Some experts blame Tron&#8217;s supply. Of course, a ton of over 100 billion tokens could keep a coin at the ground level. However, other cryptocurrency enthusiasts blame Justin Sun, the CEO of Tron. Sun is known for pushing announcements that end up not happening. Disappointments can scare off investors, and it has scared many away from buying Tron.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, during this write-up, the Tron coin price is $0.0460. It has a live market capitalization of over $3,298,073,000, and it ranks 25 among other crypto assets. Currently, the amount of Tron circulating is 71,659,657,370 TRX. However, some reports say it is 71,659,659,265 TRX that is in circulation. Meanwhile, Tron&#8217;s total token is over 100.8 billion TRX tokens. Yet, there is no information about its maximum supply. TRX currently trades on about two-hundred crypto-trading exchanges.</p>



<h2 id="tron-predictions-for-2021"><strong>Tron Predictions for 2021</strong></h2>



<p>There are various opinions and Tron predictions. Some cryptocurrency investors and analysts gave ideas on how far TRX prices could go in 2021.</p>



<h3 id="crypto-ground-tron-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Crypto Ground Tron Price Prediction 2021</strong></h3>



<p>CryptoGround is a news media website that serves cryptocurrency and blockchain news. CryptoGround predicts that the TRX coin price will drop by 34% in a year. Thus, their one-year price prediction for TRX price is $0.0219. However, CryptoGround supports long-term investments in Tron. Their Tron price prediction is that the coin will go above $0.1 in the next five years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, Wallet investor&#8217;s investment indicator shows that investors are currently bullish on Tron.</p>



<h2 id="tron-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Tron Price Prediction 2021</strong></h2>



<p>Tron is an open blockchain network that facilitates decentralized content distribution. At launch, Tron operated on the ERC-20 network. However, to fulfill its goals, Tron created its blockchain, which is the TRC-10. The Tron network has a high transaction speed, and payment fees are relatively low. Tron&#8217;s use-case also extends to the hosting of decentralized applications and smart contracts. Developers or content creators who work on the Tron network use TRX as a means of payment. Currently, there are over 23 million Tron accounts, according to stats on the Tron website. Also, over 1.6 billion transactions have been processed on the Tron network so far.</p>



<p>Moreover, there are over 1,600 decentralized applications (Dapps) on the Tron public chain. These Dapps boast of about $24.75 million in transaction volume. The growing adoption of the Tron network could be the solution to Tron&#8217;s low price.</p>



<p>TRX has existed since 2017, and it is still struggling to hit $0.1. A stagnant price is not a good sign for buyers in comparison to other crypto assets. Meanwhile, Tron CEO Justin Sun is quite influential and popular. Recently, he made it to the &#8220;Asia 30 under 30&#8221; Forbes list. However, there was no improvement in the Tron coin price. Even within the crypto community, Sun does not have much recognition. These setbacks could be the reason why the Tron price USD remains relatively low.</p>



<h2 id="tron-price-prediction-2025"><strong>Tron Price Prediction 2025</strong></h2>



<p>Majorly, long-term cryptocurrency bag holders reap high returns on investments. However, things might take the other way sometimes, and some coins may fail to pump in the long-run.

<p>Meanwhile, PRIME XBT gave their Tron price prediction based on a significant Tron current price chart analysis. An inverse head and shoulder forming on high timeframes suggest that TRX price might not spike very high as some think. However, Tron will be a profitable investment in the long term.</p>



<h2 id="tron-predictions-verdict"><strong>Tron Predictions Verdict</strong></h2>



<p>Tron is a 10-year long project. It started with the Exodus stage in 2017 and will complete at the Eternity phase by 2027. Currently, Tron is in the Great Voyage stage, and this will last till July 2021. Each step brings a new development into the Tron network and focuses on Tron&#8217;s goal – Decentralize the Web. In the end, the Tron network will provide a decentralized platform for content creators to promote their work. Completing these development stages will improve Tron news could be an add-on to drive Tron value higher.</p>



<p>To decentralize the web, Tron has to work with real firms that believe in blockchain. First, Tron Foundation acquired BitTorrent and integrated its 100 million users into the Tron network. Furthermore, Tron became partners with various companies across Asia. One of the many partners of Tron is oBike. oBike developed a utility token on the Tron blockchain, which customers can use to pay the company. Likewise, Bitmain, Zag – S&amp;W, and Global Social Chain are partners of Tron. Partnerships can spread Tron news as it drives adoption. An increase in the use of TRX will be very encouraging to investors and will enhance Tron&#8217;s value. TRX will be a profitable coin in 2021 and an excellent asset to HODL.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-bitcoin-cash-bch"><strong>What is Bitcoin Cash (BCH)?</strong></h2>



<p>Bitcoin Cash is a crypto asset that is a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain. This cryptocurrency has a number 10 ranking on CoinMarketCap. Launched in 2017, Bitcoin Cash is the first of all altcoins that are forks of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/bitcoin-explained" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a>. So what&#8217;s are your thoughts on Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2021. Over the years, more and more Bitcoin transactions were happening per second. As a result, transactions became slower since a block size of BTC is 1MB. There came to be a need for bigger block sizes and a faster transaction process. Thus, developers proposed the block size of Bitcoin Cash to be between 8MB and 32MB. Thereby processing more transactions per block and improving the network&#8217;s scalability.</p>



<p>In August 2017, developers launched the very first Bitcoin Cash software implementation. Roger Ver stated that this new cryptocurrency would help BTC fulfill its purpose and serve as a payment service. Roger Ver is an early Bitcoin investor and a Bitcoin Cash enthusiast. Back in 2018, there was a<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/bitcoin-cash-hardfork" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Bitcoin Cash fork</a>. This fork split BCH into Bitcoin Cash ABC (Bitcoin Cash Now) and Bitcoin Cash SV (Satoshi Vision). This fork was due to a disagreement on using smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain to increase the average block size.</p>



<h2 id="bitcoin-cash-price-chart"><strong>Bitcoin Cash Price Chart</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bitcoin-Cash-Price-Chart0A.png"  alt="Bitcoin Cash chart"  class="wp-image-32994" ></figure>



<h2 id="market-prediction-for-bitcoin-cash-bch-price-2021"><strong>Market Prediction for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price 2021</strong></h2>



<p>During this write-up, BCH&#8217;s price is above USD 500 with a market capitalization of $9,392,404,900. Bitcoin Cash has a gold-like market supply. Its market supply is limited, just like that of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/bitcoin-explained" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a>. Currently, its circulating supply is 18,649,950 BCH, with a maximum supply of 21,000,000 BCH coins. Thus, 89% of Bitcoin Cash has been mined. Meanwhile, BCH is currently listed on over one-hundred cryptocurrency exchanges, majorly in USDT, USD, and BTC pairs.</p>



<p>From the investment angle, Bitcoin Cash&#8217;s current price is very likely to keep moving up. 33% of investors are large holders, and over 90% of BCH holders are holding long-term. Long-term holders and large investors create bullish moves. Thus, Bitcoin Cash predictions suggest a spike in the coming months of 2021.</p>



<h3 id="bitcoin-cash-predictions-for-2021"><strong>Bitcoin Cash Predictions for 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Bitcoin Cash&#8217;s current price has gone beyond expectations, and it continues to surge. What are some forecasts and predictions for BCH price in 2021?</p>



<h4 id="digitalcoinprice-bitcoin-cash-price-prediction"><strong>DigitalCoinPrice Bitcoin Cash price prediction</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DigitalCoinPrice-Bitcoin-Cash-price-prediction0A.png"  alt="DigitalCoinPrice Bitcoin Cash price prediction"  class="wp-image-33005" ></figure>



<p>From its analysis, DigitalCoinPrice sees Bitcoin Cash price at over&nbsp;<strong>$700</strong>&nbsp;by the end of 2021. Accordingly, by the end of 2025, DigitalCoinPrice expects BCH price to be over&nbsp;<strong>$1,400</strong>. They also provide Bitcoin Cash prediction up till 2028. DigitalCoinPrice is affirmative on the fact that Bitcoin cash will increase in the future. Furthermore, in 7 years, they predict that we will have BCH over&nbsp;<strong>$2,000</strong>.</p>



<h4 id="wallet-investor-bitcoin-cash-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Wallet Investor Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2021</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Wallet-Investor-Bitcoin-Cash-Price-Prediction-20210A.png"  alt="Wallet Investor Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2021"  class="wp-image-33016" ></figure>



<p>According to Wallet Investor, BCH might be a lousy long-term or 1-year investment. Their prediction stands around&nbsp;<strong>$420 per Bitcoin Cash</strong>&nbsp;at the end of 2021. Wallet Investor says from their technical analysis; Bitcoin Cash might be a long-term foul play for investors. Wallet Investor also stresses that although Bitcoin Cash will not hit $1,000 in a year, BCH can never crash.</p>



<h4 id="tradingbeasts-bitcoin-cash-price-prediction-2021"><strong>TradingBeasts Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2021</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/TradingBeasts-Bitcoin-Cash-Price-Prediction-20210A.png"  alt="TradingBeasts Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2021"  class="wp-image-33027" ></figure>



<p>TradingBeasts, however, forecasts a bullish play for long-term holders of Bitcoin Cash. Their Bitcoin Cash price prediction stands at&nbsp;<strong>$574 per BCH</strong>. While TradingBeasts&#8217; projection depicts monthly retracements and average highs and lows, BCH will close at over&nbsp;<strong>$500</strong>&nbsp;by December 2021, according to TradingBeasts.</p>



<h4 id="long-forecast-bitcoin-cash-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Long Forecast Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2021</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Long-Forecast-Bitcoin-Cash-Price-Prediction-20210A.png"  alt="Long Forecast Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2021"  class="wp-image-33038" ></figure>



<p>Longforecast seems to have a bullish prediction for BCH price. According to their analysis, BCH will close at over $1,000 by July but will dump to over $800 by December. Although this forecast still depicts a bullish close for the year, it might cause a bearish move in 2022. Even though this is just a forecast, the analysis might play out, and it&#8217;s just a matter of time for us to find out.</p>



<h4 id="roger-ver-bitcoin-cash-coin-price-prediction"><strong>Roger Ver Bitcoin Cash Coin Price prediction</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Roger-Ver-Bitcoin-Cash-Coin-Price-prediction0A.png"  alt="Roger Ver Bitcoin Cash Coin Price prediction"  class="wp-image-33049" ></figure>



<p>Bitcoin early investor Roger Ver is an optimist of Bitcoin Cash. The Bitcoin Cash enthusiast tweeted earlier in January that when Bitcoin Cash hits $500, it will be like when Bitcoin hit $50. Ver says the financial market worldwide is ten times bigger than the gold market. Thus, prices of assets like BCH will always skyrocket.</p>



<p>A few days after the previous tweet, Ver tweeted about Bitcoin Cash again. He said that while Bitcoin may replace Gold, Bitcoin Cash may replace fiat currencies.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Roger-Ver-Bitcoin-Cash-Coin-Price-prediction0A-2.png"  alt="Roger Ver Bitcoin Cash Coin Price prediction"  class="wp-image-33060" ></figure>



<p>Although Roger Ver does not give a specific Bitcoin Cash price prediction, his tweets suggest massive bullish moves for BCH.</p>



<h2 id="bitcoin-cash-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2021</strong></h2>



<p>Back in 2020, Bitcoin Cash had about 60% annual price gain. Meanwhile, since January 4, 2021, BCH&#8217;s price has not gone below&nbsp;<strong>$400</strong>. One thing that might affect Bitcoin Cash coin price is the recent hard fork. Remember, the split was due to low trust among crypto and Bitcoin developers and communities. Some Bitcoin Cash protocols sways away from Bitcoin&#8217;s original philosophy, hence the hard fork. Since BCH now has rivals, some market forces might push its price downwards in the long run.</p>



<p>On the other hand, none of that might affect Bitcoin Cash. As Bitcoin Cash news suggests, BCH brought better scalability than the Bitcoin blockchain. Transactions are not as slow as predicted, and payment fees are low. Bitcoin Cash continues to gain popularity. It is listed on most of the top-rated exchanges, including Coinbase. Also, some services are beginning to accept Bitcoin Cash as a payment method. Even South Africans can pay for legal services with Bitcoin Cash. Hence, more investors might buy into Bitcoin Cash soon.</p>



<h2 id="bitcoin-cash-price-prediction-2025"><strong>Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2025</strong></h2>



<p>Many predictions available for Bitcoin Cash 2025 price are analyzed based on the current BCH price. Not many investors and crypto enthusiasts have given such a long-term forecast for Bitcoin Cash. Meanwhile, Roger Ver gave his long-term speculation for Bitcoin Cash, saying it might replace fiat currencies. Of course, that is not happening too soon.</p>



<p>Judging by the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/bitcoin-explained" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a>&nbsp;perspective, Bitcoin Cash coin price is expected to be in the thousand-dollar figure by 2025 because Bitcoin itself should be worth some six-figures by 2025. Roger Ver likewise made this claim when he said Bitcoin Cash value at $500 would be equal to BTC at $50.</p>



<h2 id="bitcoin-cash-price-prediction-verdict"><strong>Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction Verdict</strong></h2>



<p>Following the current bull run or alt season the crypto market is experiencing, Bitcoin Cash is not left out. Bitcoin Cash price USD has gone from $400 since January to over $500, the Bitcoin Cash current price range. On January 11, Bitcoin Cash price USD went above $600. That is about a 40% increase in 2021 alone, and the price continues to increase. Also, a very high percent of Bitcoin Cash holders are long-term investors; thus, a good chunk of the asset is not in circulation. So, considering market instabilities, Bitcoin Cash price USD might reach an&nbsp;<strong>$800</strong>&nbsp;price mark and beyond in 2021.</p>



<p>Likewise, more than 18 million out of the overall 21 million Bitcoin Cash value supply have been bought. Thus, the supply continues to decrease. As Bitcoin Cash news spreads, the media will also begin to publicize BCH for everyone. With a declining pool and a possible hype in Bitcoin Cash news, Bitcoin Cash value might eventually surge. Thus, Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency worthy of buying in 2021. Just as Bitcoin had ups and downs, Bitcoin Cash coin price, too, might have the same fluctuations. However, the coin will be a good play out in the long run.</p>



<p>Investors and those who decide to buy Bitcoin Cash (BCH) can do so on Atomic Wallet. Atomic wallet allows you to buy Bitcoin Cash directly. Atomic Wallet is available for download on Google Play.</p>

<h2 id="litecoin-price-prediction-amp-forecast-2021"><strong>Litecoin Price Prediction &amp; Forecast 2021</strong></h2>



<h3 id="will-litecoin-ltc-rise-or-fall-in-2021"><strong>Will Litecoin (LTC) rise or fall in 2021?</strong></h3>



<p>Going back to 2017, Litecoin had its all-time-high of $375. Although it dumped to retest at a low price, Litecoin stood on its feet again in 2020. Meanwhile, its price is still very much below that all-time-high. Currently, LTC has seen about a 30% increase in 2021. After setting its first higher high after a higher low, Litecoin might be looking at an uptrend market. Also, Litecoin Foundation has been pushing the project by sponsoring brands. NFL and UFC are examples of these sports brands. Media awareness can create an increase in demand.</p>



<p>Thus, putting all these together, Litecoin seems to be a good coin to buy in 2021.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-monero-xmr"><strong>What is Monero (XMR)?</strong></h2>



<p>Monero is an open-source cryptocurrency that gives much priority to privacy and anonymity. Launched in 2014, Monero is one of the first crypto assets that features cryptography. Monero&#8217;s blockchain operates majorly on the concept of keeping user&#8217;s information anonymous. Although Bitcoin also claims to keep transactions private, BTC payments are still traceable. Thus, Monero blockchain developers were successful in building a private and fungible cryptocurrency system.</p>



<p>We can trace Monero back to Bytecoin, which came into existence in 2012. Meanwhile, Bytecoin was an early implementation of CryptoNote and was also privacy-oriented. CryptoNote is a protocol used in the creation of decentralized cryptocurrencies. Later on, there were allegations that Bytecoin developers had sold 80% of the coin already. So, in April 2014, there was a fork of Bytecoin, which gave birth to Bitmonero. Eventually, Bitmonero developers renamed it Monero (which in Esperanto means &#8220;coin&#8221;).</p>



<p>The Monero blockchain has over time introduced fungibility, stealth addresses, ring signature, and RingCT. Thereby eliminating any glitch in user privacy. Stealth addresses enable users to create a different address for every transaction they perform in their account. Thus, the blockchain hides the destination address of a transaction. Likewise, ring signatures mix the sender&#8217;s account keys with public keys. Therefore, the identity of a sender will be unknown. Furthermore, RingCT or Ring Confidential Transactions is a tool to hide transaction amounts. So, the Monero blockchain successfully conceals information about a transaction sender, receiver, and amount.</p>

<h2 id="market-prediction-for-monero-xmr-price-2021"><strong>Market Prediction for Monero (XMR) Price 2021</strong></h2>



<p>Monero&#8217;s current price has gone above&nbsp;<strong>$270</strong>&nbsp;as of this write-up. With a CoinMarketCap ranking of 18, XMR has a market capitalization of $4,837,551,144. Likewise, its circulating supply and total supply are the same – 17,843,406 XMR tokens. Meanwhile, there is no information about Monero&#8217;s maximum supply. However, by May 2022, XMR will eventually have a maximum of 18.4 million tokens. After that, miners will earn part of the little XMR coins fed into the system every minute. In the meantime, a new block is added to the Monero every two minutes.</p>



<p>From January 2021 to this time, Monero prices have had a&nbsp;<strong>43%</strong>&nbsp;increase. Also, from February 2020 to February 2021, XMR prices have jumped by over&nbsp;<strong>74%.&nbsp;</strong>The all-time high for the Monero coin price is&nbsp;<strong>$495</strong>, and Monero made it to this price three years ago in January 2018. The lowest Monero value in the coin&#8217;s history is&nbsp;<strong>$0.21</strong>, which was in January 2015. Looking at Monero news – its scalability and efficiency, Will it pump more in 2021? Let us see the opinions of expert analysts and investors on how far Monero will go in 2021.</p>

<h3 id="trading-beasts-monero-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Trading Beasts Monero Price Prediction 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Trading Beasts gave a bearish Monero price prediction for 2021. Currently, they foresee the Monero coin price closing at an average of $<strong>233 by December 2021</strong>. Meanwhile, within a year, Trading Beasts forecast that Monero price USD will close above $298. Also, they do not see a drastic increase in Monero value by 2022.</p>

<p>Crypto forecast website Wallet Investor also has bearish Monero predictions for 2021. They tagged XMR as a bad one-year investment. However, Wallet Investor is bullish on the 5-year forecast of XMR. They foresee XMR pumping over 47% by 2026. Meanwhile, their 2021 and 2022 prediction chart suggest that XMR prices will not drop below&nbsp;<strong>$150</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="longforecast-monero-predictions-2021"><strong>Longforecast Monero Predictions 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Longforecast is as well quite bullish on Monero in 2021. According to their analysis, there will be a 261% increase in Monero&#8217;s current price in 2021. However, by December 2022, Longforecast predicts that Monero value would have dumped to $355. This prediction site also estimates a bearish move for XMR by 2025.</p>

<p>Digitalcoin is a crypto analysis website that makes price predictions based on historical data. Using Monero&#8217;s current price, Digitalcoin was able to make expert forecasts on XMR. The website predicts that&nbsp;<strong>by November</strong>, XMR will be over $455. However, due to stock market instabilities, the Monero value will close below&nbsp;<strong>$400</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="peter-todd-monero-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Peter Todd Monero Price Prediction 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd stated expressed support for Monero sometime ago. Peter said he prefers XMR to other cryptocurrencies due to the solutions it offers. Remember, Monero provides real-life privacy for its transaction environment. Therefore, experts like Peter Todd see a bright future for Monero.</p>



<h2 id="monero-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Monero Price Prediction 2021</strong></h2>



<p>Monero is a project that facilitates maximum transaction privacy. Transactions are neither traceable nor trackable. As a result, XMR tokens are fungible and can be used to fund illegal activities. Although we do not encourage illegal transactions, the massive purchase of a crypto asset increases its price. So, the Monero current price will keep increasing if it frequently moves in large chunks.</p>



<p>On top of that, the team behind Monero continues to work. The team has significantly improved the blockchain technology of Monero. A new proof-of-work protocol – RandomX, was recently introduced. Blockchain upgrades can help invite new products and projects to launch on Monero the protocol. When products launch on the Monero blockchain, the adoption of such projects could increase XMR prices drastically. However, market instabilities could as well cause a dump in Monero coin price.</p>



<h2 id="monero-price-prediction-2025"><strong>Monero Price Prediction 2025</strong></h2>



<p>In its early days, John McAfee gave a very positive forecast regarding Monero price. In several interviews, he has given very vocal support for Monero. John thinks Monero can challenge Bitcoin because of its privacy use-case. Meanwhile, he did not give an exact price prediction for the coin. John McAfee is a software developer and a cryptocurrency enthusiast.</p>



<p>Likewise, crypto developer Riccardo Spagni based his Monero predictions on Monero&#8217;s privacy. Criminal hackers adopt Monero for their transactions. As above, a widespread use for activities like that can increase Monero coin price in the future.</p>



<p>The expert prediction website Wallet Investor predicts Monero price USD to be above $600 by 2025. Of course, a 100% pump in price is feasible for such a long-term period.</p>



<h2 id="monero-price-prediction-verdict"><strong>Monero Price Prediction Verdict</strong></h2>



<p>By May 2022, miners would have completed the last blocks of Monero. Monero does not have a maximum supply yet. Consequently, an unknown maximum token could be damaging for its future price. Like Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies with a max supply experience price increase following the law of demand and supply. Thus, the Monero team needs to settle for a maximum amount to push the Monero news.</p>



<p>Looking at Monero&#8217;s current price and technical analysis, the coin is good for a buy-in in 2021. There has been a significant increase in Monero price USD so far in 2021. Recently, there have been some challenges for the cryptocurrency market. However, as the market recovers, XMR price will also gain more strength. Remember, Monero is at the forefront of privacy in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>



<p>We encourage investors to do further research about Monero before buying it. If you find Monero a satisfying project, you can buy XMR on Atomic Wallet. Atomic Wallet is available for free download!</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EOS-PRICE-PREDICTION-2021-1918x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33756" ></figure>



<h2 id="what-is-eos"><strong>What is EOS?</strong></h2>



<p>EOSIO is a blockchain that aims to provide a better and more flexible transaction process. EOS is a token of the EOSIO network. This network provides a decentralized operating system. Likewise, the EOSIO use-case includes server hosting and cloud storage services, thereby allowing developers to build dApps and smart contracts more straightforwardly. In some manner, EOS is a competitor to the Ethereum blockchain.</p>



<p>It solves the gas fees problem, which is a significant setback for the Ethereum network. To use the EOSIO network, developers have to hold some of the tokens. Developers do not necessarily pay any fee; they only have to own or stake some EOS tokens. Similarly, EOS beats Ethereum in that it is capable of processing thousands of transactions every second. DApps created on EOSIO are accessible by all blockchain users. Thus, the EOSIO platform benefits everyone.</p>



<p>In June 2017, EOS began its initial coin offering, which would go on for one year. EOS raised over $4 billion by June 2018, when the blockchain went live. After the ICO, EOS value could boast of a market cap of about $13 billion. The brains behind this project are Dan Larimer and Brendan Blumer. Meanwhile, Dan Larimer already owns two blockchain platforms (Bitshares and Steemit). Likewise, Brendan Blumer is the CEO of Block.one, the company in charge of EOS.</p>



<h2 id="eos-price-chart"><strong>EOS Price Chart</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EOS-Price-Chart0A.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33690" ></figure>



<h2 id="market-prediction-for-eos-price-2021"><strong>Market Prediction for EOS price 2021</strong></h2>



<p>At the close of 2020, EOS&#8217;s Relative Strength Index was above 40. The EOS coin price found support at $2.3 and resistance at $3.8 since February 2020. However, in February 2021, there was a breakout from resistance, and there is minimal potential for a retest. EOS price currently stands at $4.80. EOS ranks 19 in the list of cryptocurrencies. It has a market capitalization of $4,542,575,800; this is a vast reduction from 2018&#8217;s $13 billion.</p>



<p>EOS has a total supply of 1,027,124,687, and its circulating supply is over 950 million EOS coins. However, there is currently no data for EOS maximum supply. During the ICO, the EOS coin price reached an all-time high of $22.8 on April 29, 2018. Likewise, the coin&#8217;s all-time-low was $0.48, which was also during the one-year-long ICO. EOS trades on over 100 exchanges, including Binance.</p>



<h2 id="eos-predictions-for-2021"><strong>EOS Predictions for 2021</strong></h2>



<p>Various experts and cryptocurrency investors have different EOS predictions. Some foresee a very bullish move in EOS value this year. However, some experts have reasons to forecast a reduction in EOS coin price in 2021.</p>



<h3 id="satis-group-eos-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Satis Group EOS Price Prediction 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Satis Group, an ICO advisory firm, gave a prediction for EOS back in 2018. Satis Group makes predictions based on top-down analysis of markets of crypto assets. According to them, EOS will have a 42% reduction in price from $6 in 2018 to $3.6 in 2021. Their 3-year EOS predictions came to pass as the coin had a $3.6 price in January 2021. However, this was for a short time as EOS now sells for almost $4.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Satis-Group-EOS-Price-Prediction-20210A.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33701" ></figure>



<h3 id="marginbuu-eos-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Marginbuu EOS Price Prediction 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Marginbuu, a popular Trading View user, is quite bullish on EOS. He sees Dan Larimer as a bad PR for the coin.</p>



<p>&#8220;Either way, it can only be good news that Dan Larimer is gone. He is terrible at PR and is hated in the crypto community.&#8221;</p>



<p>Marginbuu called EOS the &#8220;slowest grower in crypto.&#8221; However, he still has some hope in the asset if they appoint a new CTO.</p>



<p>&#8220;As soon as Brenda announces a new CTO, EOS price USD can shoot up to $10,&#8221; he added. Likewise, on January 6, 2021, Margunbuu said that EOS&#8217; bull season&#8217; will begin as soon as it passes $4. Could the bull season be now?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Marginbuu-EOS-Price-Prediction-20210A.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33712" ></figure>



<h3 id="trading-beasts-eos-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Trading Beasts EOS Price Prediction 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Trading beasts gave a bearish prediction for EOS price. According to them, EOS value is going to reduce in 2021. Likewise, they do not foresee a spike in EOS coin price in 2022. By the end of March, Trading Beasts expect EOS to close at $4.65. Meanwhile, by December 2021, EOS might close at $4.81, suggesting a bearish EOS news in 2021.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trading-Beasts-EOS-Price-Prediction-20210A.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33723" ></figure>



<h3 id="wallet-investor-eos-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Wallet Investor EOS Price Prediction 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Wallet Investor uses a historical index to predict the future price of cryptocurrencies. They see EOS as a high-risk investment for long-term holders. EOS&#8217;s current price is almost $5. However, Wallet Investor predicts a dump in its price down to $3.3, which is about a 30% decrease. Likewise, their EOS price prediction does not suggest a pump to $10 anytime soon.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Wallet-Investor-EOS-Price-Prediction-20210A.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33734" ></figure>



<h3 id="brave-new-coin-eos-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Brave New Coin EOS Price Prediction 2021</strong></h3>



<p>In a YouTube video, Brave New Coin made their analysis of EOS&#8217;s 2021 moves. Brave New Coin explained that EOS price USD has been bearish over the years. Also, since its 2018 all-time-high, it has not made any other significant moves. It seems to be maintaining its yearly support and resistance levels. Therefore, EOS has to break the current consolidation to impress investors. The video host mentioned he could not trade EOS because nothing is exciting about the coin. Brave New Coin is a Crypto Asset Market Data firm.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Brave-New-Coin-EOS-Price-Prediction-20210A.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33745" ></figure>



<h2 id="eos-price-prediction-2021"><strong>EOS Price Prediction 2021</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a good look at EOS fundamental and technical analysis, the coin seems to be bearish. There have been regular retests of its support and resistance zones. Likewise, the cryptocurrency has not gone anywhere close to its all-time-high since its launch. For now, EOS charts suggest more bearish than a bullish move. However, EOS price USD might close higher than $10 if there is a successful breakout from its current resistance zones.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, EOS is a token for the EOSIO network. The EOSIO blockchain facilitates faster transactions and has a high throughput. Thus, if more projects launch on the blockchain, this can boost usage of the token. An increase in token adoption means an increase in price (all things being equal). However, EOS might have a setback in network usage as a result of competitors. A lot of projects are still launching on the Ethereum network. Likewise, the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a significant competitor for EOSIO.</p>



<h2 id="eos-price-prediction-2025"><strong>EOS Price Prediction 2025</strong></h2>



<p>From now till 2025, the EOS news might go viral. Likewise, just like other cryptocurrencies, most long-term investments turn out fruitful. EOS should not be left out as well. EOSIO and its parent company, Block.one, have influential crypto investors backing the project. Also, news, economic events, and political regulations positively affect cryptocurrencies sometimes. Thus, EOS price USD should be more than double in such an extended range of time.</p>



<p>Mike Novogratz, the founder of Galaxy Digital, a Crypto Investment firm, is one of the large holders of EOS. Currently, Galaxy Digital is in partnership with EOSIO. The company has an EOS fund called the Galaxy EOS VC Fund. The fund invests in projects building on the EOSIO blockchain. Novogratz said he would keep working with Block.one because he believes in the outperformance of their project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Likewise, Ali Ayyash, CEO of Lumeous, is quite an enthusiast of the EOS network. He claims EOS might beat Ethereum soon. Institutional Investors like Galaxy Digital and Lumeous are what EOS might need to push its price. With brilliant investors in support of the project, EOS predictions for 2025 will be a bullish move.</p>



<h2 id="eos-price-prediction-verdict"><strong>EOS Price Prediction Verdict</strong></h2>



<p>The EOSIO protocol has some level of support. As a result, high adoption might push its price high. In the coming months of 2021, EOS news might gain recognition in the cryptocurrency space. Furthermore, in coming years, the EOS coin piece will not remain the way it is. Market forces will push the project forward.</p>



<p>EOS&#8217;s current price suggests the coin is heading up. However, from experience, there might be another correction on its way to the top. Meanwhile, for EOS news to receive more attention, there has to be an exciting update about it. The team has to work harder to push the project to the world. Although EOS tries to create a democratic blockchain, traders like Marginbuu think EOS has a bad PR. The team might want to work on building a more efficient community for the EOSIO project.</p>



<p>EOS is suitable for long-term buy as it has a solution-driven use case. Investors should see this crypto asset as an exciting option. Meanwhile, Atomic Wallet allows you to manage EOS in a decentralized wallet.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-buy-eos"><strong>How to Buy EOS</strong></h2>



<p>Atomic Wallet is a multi-function decentralized wallet where users can store crypto assets. You can also buy cryptocurrencies directly through your Atomic Wallet app. Your funds&#8217; safety and privacy are top priorities, and you should always keep your wallet info private.

<p>Meanwhile, Atomic Wallet does not support buying EOS directly for now. Of course, this feature will be available in the future. However, users can securely store their EOS tokens in Atomic Wallet.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-exchange-eos"><strong>How to Exchange EOS</strong></h2>



<p>As part of its decentralized features, Atomic Wallet supports coin exchange. The wallet currently has many exchange pairs with excellent rates.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/what-is-tron-trx-1920x1080.png"  alt="" ></figure>



<p>Entertainment is an essential part of our lives. Likewise, created content has to be distributed to reach its intended audience. While there are traditional distribution methods, the media industry is in control of few large companies. Apple, Facebook, and YouTube strictly censor what you view or publish on their platforms. They also receive most of the revenue the media generates. They are thereby leaving creators with a small portion of whatever money their content makes. However, Tron has developed a unique solution to this challenge.</p>



<p>Tron has made a<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-decentralization" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;decentralized</a>&nbsp;entertainment platform that allows users to create, access easily, and share digital content. Tron uses blockchain and peer to peer (P2P) technology to meet its goal. Meanwhile, this review will give users vital information about the Tron project. It will also discuss the Tron coin (TRX).</p>



<h3 id="what-is-tron-coin"><strong>What is Tron Coin?</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/what-is-tron-trx.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34035" ></figure>



<p>Tron is a project dedicated to developing entirely<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-decentralization" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;decentralized</a>&nbsp;internet infrastructure. Therefore, this project operates without a central body or middle man. As a result, It enables direct interaction between end-users and resources. These exciting concepts give Tron the potential to:</p>



<ul><li>Decentralize the web</li><li>Create a digital marketplace for content developers and consumers</li><li>Create a mobile app marketplace</li><li>Create a cryptocurrency with a vast use-case and without territorial restrictions</li></ul>



<p>Tron protocol offers public blockchain support of high output, high scalability, and high availability for all<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-are-dapps" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Decentralized Applications</a>&nbsp;(DApps) in the Tron ecosystem. TRX stands for Tronix, which is the official cryptocurrency of the Tron coin. TRX uses Tron network TRC-10. Tron uses this coin to pay users who create content on their platform. Similarly, you can trade Trx on many crypto exchanges. Meanwhile, Tronix (TRX) can handle about 2,000 transactions and transfers every second.</p>



<p>In contrast,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/bitcoin-explained" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a>&nbsp;(BTC) can only process 3-6 transactions per second. Likewise,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-ethereum-blockchain" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>&nbsp;can handle just 25 transfers per second. Therefore, giving Tron a higher throughput in comparison to its predecessors.</p>



<p>How does Tron process transactions? Just like other crypto assets, TRX transactions occur on a public ledger. The history of all transactions on the Tron network is traceable to the public ledger&#8217;s first transaction. Tron&#8217;s ledger is like&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/bitcoin-explained" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin&#8217;s</a>&nbsp;transaction model. However, Tron&#8217;s transactions have more security. Tron&#8217;s transaction model is known as UTXO. When you send TRX to a user&#8217;s address in a UTXO model, the money sends along with some rules. The set of rules will then unlock the amount of TRX sent. Thus, the end product is an output known as UTXO.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the UTXO model is majorly meant for developers to understand fully. Users should focus on the overall use-case behind the Tron project. Tron gives you overall control over the content you create and distribute.</p>



<h3 id="brief-history-of-tron"><strong>Brief History of Tron</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/history-of-tron-trx.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34024" ></figure>



<p>Tron foundation was established in Singapore in July 2017 by Justin Sun. Tron Foundation is a non-profit making organization that operates the Tron network. The foundation supports Tron&#8217;s development team by ensuring they keep to the principles of transparency and fairness while developing Tron. Tron foundation holds approval from the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority. This regulatory commission works in due accordance with the Company Law of Singapore.</p>



<p>Background developers of Tron are cryptocurrency enthusiasts who work for big firms like Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent. Tron Foundation raised $70 million through an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017. Tron was first listed on Coinmarketcap on September 13, 2017, at $0.002. The all-time high of the crypto coin is $0.30, which was on January 5, 2018. Currently, its price is in the range of @0.025 and $0.03. Justin Sun is the founder of Peiwo, a china-based live streaming app with over 10 million active subscribers. Tron has been integrated into Peiwo. Therefore, this has built high recognition for the cryptocurrency around China.</p>



<p>Sun was also a former Chief Representative of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/how-to-choose-ripple-wallet" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple</a>&nbsp;in China. Therefore, Sun is not a newbie in the FinTech or cryptocurrency industry. He is a close accomplice to Jack Ma, the billionaire behind Alibaba. Justin Sun is a graduate of Jack Ma&#8217;s Hupan University. Surprisingly, few months after graduating, Sun made it into Forbes &#8220;China 30 under 30&#8221; and &#8220;Asia 30 under 30&#8221; lists.</p>



<p>Key personnel along with Justin Sun on the Tron project are:</p>



<ul><li>CTO of Tron – Lucien Chen</li><li>Technical Director – Keelson Yang</li><li>Developer – Xie Xiaodong.</li></ul>



<p>In December 2017, Tron launched its open-source protocol. The Tron protocol is very scalable. It is capable of handling a growing amount of work. Similarly, it can accommodate an enlarged network. Tron launched its Testnet, Blockchain explorer, and web wallet in March 2018.</p>



<p>Tron bought BitTorrent in July 2018, thereby combining BitTorrent&#8217;s 100 million users with their network. Also, Tron was able to launch new DApps on the Tron network.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="advantages-and-disadvantages-of-tron"><strong>Advantages and Disadvantages of Tron</strong></h3>



<p>In a bid to provide a fully transparent and stress-free transaction environment, the Tron technology eliminates intermediaries in its transactions, and users can make better use of resources. Therefore, Tron&#8217;s storage protocol is distributed. The introduction of a graph database notion into the design was an excellent idea. As a result, it meets the requirements to diversify data storage.</p>



<ul><li><strong>High throughput</strong>&nbsp;– Tron network supports about 2000 transfers every second. As a result, the Tron coin (TRX) has a breakneck transaction speed. Therefore, when Tron finally achieves its goal to decentralize the content creation industry, there will be enough space to complete transactions. Unlike its predecessors like&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-ethereum-blockchain" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>&nbsp;and the ERC-20 network, Tron has a competitive edge.</li><li><strong>Creation of</strong><a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-are-dapps" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Decentralized Apps</a><strong>&nbsp;(dApps)</strong>&nbsp;– Tron allows developers to create a diverse range of dApps, making its applications limitless. Developers who create dApps that offer content will earn crypto assets in return. Payments will be either in TRX tokens or in a token you have created on the TRX network. Therefore, you receive your compensations in full, and no middle-men will slice your money.</li><li><strong>Tron eliminates transaction fees&nbsp;</strong>– there are no charges or fees when making a TRX transaction. You only have to pay the internal network fees, which ensure your transaction is safely added to the network. Meanwhile, the network fee is not the same as what you pay for other cryptocurrencies. Tron uses Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) protocol. Therefore, users pay using Bandwidth Energy.</li></ul>



<p>Bandwidth refers to the volume of network required to execute and save transactions. Meanwhile, the price is fixed and may not be paid while making simple transactions. Similarly, there is some level of free bandwidth on the Tron network. Approximately, you can make 15 financial transactions for free. As for Energy, only dApps and smart contracts need a little energy. Just like gas fees in&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-ethereum-blockchain" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>. Often, zero Energy is used for transfers. However, to receive free Bandwidth and Energy, you may freeze some of your TRX coins. Freezing also makes TRX scarce, and scarcity breeds a bullish market.</p>



<h3 id="tron-technology"><strong>Tron Technology</strong></h3>



<p>Tron is a long-term project with six planned stages; Exodus, Odyssey, Great Voyage, Apollo, Star Trek, and Eternity. These stages will last till 2027.</p>



<h4 id="the-exodus-stage">The Exodus stage</h4>



<p>Exodus is the first phase of Tron&#8217;s development. Therefore, its primary focus was on data liberation. Exodus is a platform for free peer-to-peer content distribution and storage. Similarly, it allows consumers to store and access information and release it to Tron users. This phase was the design for the top-level of Tron&#8217;s system and protocols of the public chain. The Exodus stage began in August 2017 and came to an end in December 2018.</p>



<h4 id="odyssey">Odyssey</h4>



<p>The second stage is a significant phase as well. Odyssey ensures the large-scale development of Tron&#8217;s public chain. Essential versions of Odyssey include:</p>



<h4 id="odyssey-v1-0-this-is-the-test-net-version-of-the-tron-public-chain">Odyssey v1.0 – this is the test net version of the Tron public chain.</h4>



<p>Odyssey v2.0 – the main net version of Tron public chain. This version features an improved network, a new bandwidth model, and account creation. Tron built Odyssey v2.0 to:</p>



<ol><li>Optimize handshake logic</li><li>Enhance sending ping messages</li><li>Utilize message entities and net log</li><li>Solve disconnection problem</li><li>Send message thread and handle message thread</li><li>Resolve repeated transaction in the network module</li></ol>



<p>The following are the features and requirements of the new bandwidth model:</p>



<ol><li>For token transfers, Tron will charge bandwidth points from the issuer if points are enough.</li><li>If there is enough, the initiator will as well pay bandwidth points.</li><li>The initiator will be charged TRX. After that, the TRX will be burnt.</li></ol>



<p>To create a wallet using a private key, you will need to invoke one of these APIs:</p>



<ol><li>Invoke account creation API directly</li><li>Send TRX to the address</li><li>Send tokens to the address</li></ol>



<p>Odyssey v3.0 – Tron built the Tron Virtual Machine (TVM) in this version. TVM is a lightweight virtual machine that is Turing complete. It was built exclusively for the Tron&#8217;s ecosystem. Its objective is to deliver a custom-built blockchain ecosystem that is efficient, secure, and scalable. TVM uses the concept of Energy. Therefore, transactions and smart contracts on TVM are free of TRX consumption. In contrast,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-ethereum-blockchain" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum&#8217;s</a>&nbsp;EVM employs a Gas mechanism, which makes operations on the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-ethereum-blockchain" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>&nbsp;blockchain expensive. Performance of TVM includes:</p>



<p><strong>Lightweight Architecture:</strong>&nbsp;TVM adopts a lightweight architecture to reduce resource consumption. Therefore, there is a guarantee of better system performance.</p>



<p>Robust – TRX transactions and smart contract execution cost only bandwidth points. Transfers do not cost TRX. Hence there is no attack on TRON. Also, the computational step cost is fixed. Therefore, bandwidth consumption is predictable and static.</p>



<p>Highly Compatible – TVM is currently compatible with&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-ethereum-blockchain" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>&nbsp;Virtual Machine (EVM). Thus, all smart contracts on EVM are executable on TVM. Soon, TVM will be compatible with more mainstream virtual machines.</p>



<p><strong>Low Fee:</strong>&nbsp;As a result of TVM&#8217;s bandwidth setup, the cost of development is reduced. Therefore, developers can focus more on the reasonable development of their smart contracts. Likewise, TVM offers an all-in-one interface for contract deployment. In like manner, Tron offers developers convenience in triggering their contract codes.</p>



<p>Odyssey v3.2 – this version is an in-memory database for full access to Tron public data.</p>



<p>Odyssey v3.5 – this version supports multiple signature and account management.</p>



<p>Odyssey v3.5.1 – this phase saw the introduction of Rocks DB as a new primary data engine.</p>



<p>Odyssey v3.6.5 – this serves as a<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-decentralization" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;decentralized</a>&nbsp;incentive mechanism. This version centers on content empowerment to provide fair returns for content creators. Meanwhile, this version aims to cut out middlemen such as Apple Store so content creators can receive funds from their customers directly.</p>



<p>The Odyssey stage lasted for 18 months (January 2019 to June 2020).</p>



<h4 id="great-voyage">Great Voyage</h4>



<p>Great Voyage v4.0 – this is a consensus mechanism for Tron Proof of Stake (TPoS).</p>



<p>Tron development is still at the Great Voyage stage. Great Voyage will last for 12 months (July 2020 to July 2021).</p>



<p>The three last stages aim to provide<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-decentralization" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;decentralized</a>&nbsp;ICOs, forecasting, and gaming platforms. Including online casinos that will use blockchain technology. All platforms will be launched using Tron 20 standard. Apollo will last from August 2021 till March 2023. Likewise, Star Trek will last between April 2023 and September 2025. Finally, Eternity will mark the end of the 10-year roadmap of the Tron ecosystem. This phase will last from October 2025 and end in September 2027.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="perspectives-and-takeaways"><strong>Perspectives and Takeaways</strong></h3>

<p>Tron has provided a unique alternative for content creators and consumers with its<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-decentralization" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;decentralized</a>&nbsp;entertainment platform. This use of blockchain technology is widely accepted among content creators. Similarly, Tron holds partnerships with lots of top brands in the crypto space. For example, Tron is in alliance with oBike, a multinational bike-sharing company based in Singapore. oBike has over 10 million users across Southeast Asia. oBike launched its token oCoin on Tron&#8217;s network. Customers of oBike accumulate oCoins by patronizing the company. They can then use their tokens to purchase rides from oBike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Likewise, Tron is in partnership with Global Social Chain, a social network with over 100 million people. They are as well in collaboration with game.com. Moreover, TRX is in partnership with Bitmain. Bitmain is a top designer and leading producer of ASIC chips that are used to<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/mining-pools" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;mine Bitcoin</a>. Furthermore, Tron is in partnership with Zag – S&amp;W. Zag is a leading international law firm with a Legacy 500. This company focuses on commercial law. Thus, this is a promising addition to Tron&#8217;s connection with some of the world&#8217;s leading companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These partnerships show a growing acceptance of Tron. Also, it assures users of their safety. Furthermore, Tron is expanding its activities. For example, on October 2, 2020, Coindesk reported that Tron had plans to acquire blockchain-based e-sport service Dlive.tv. Dlive will be moved into an entity called BitTorrent X.</p>
