<p>Ripple XRP Price Prediction &amp; Forecast 2021: Will Ripple value increase or decline in 2021 and beyond? Know all the details on Ripple&#8217;s future 2021 trend with a detailed analysis.</p>



<p>Ripple <a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-cryptocurrency" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryptocurrency</a>, which used to be one of the top three cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, recently saw its price plummet. This is due to a lawsuit filed against the blockchain company by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for allegedly selling unregistered securities under federal securities law. In response to the sudden lawsuit, major digital assets trading platforms announced a halt in trading of the XRP, and some even went further to delist the asset. </p>



<p>Population crypto assets custodian also had no option than to respond in a way to comply with regulations. Institutional-grade digital asset firm Grayscale Investment also took action to dissolve its XRP Trust, liquidate its XRP holdings, and distribute cash to the Trust&#8217;s shareholders. This, coupled with other happenings, is perceived to have contributed to Ripple&#8217;s decline in price in recent times. Despite all these, Ripple has been vibrant in its business and continues to render better services to its clients.</p>



<h6 id="the-start">The start</h6>



<p>Are you considering holding some XRP and want to know how much XRP will be valued in 2021 and beyond? Let&#8217;s look at the current state of Ripple as company and experts&#8217; opinions on XRP price.</p>



<h3 id="what-is-ripple-xrp"><strong>What is Ripple (XRP)</strong></h3>



<p>To better understand <a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/ripple-wallet" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple</a> and how it works. We will need to familiarize ourselves with some of the common terminologies you are likely to encounter. Let&#8217;s begin with XRP, the native digital currency that runs on the XRP ledger &#8211; an open-source, decentralized, and permissionless ledger. XRP as an asset is purposely designed for payments. Crypto holders can send XRP to anyone in the world without the need for a central entity to facilitate the process. Using XRP for financial transactions is cost-effective, scalable, and fast as compared to other alternatives.</p>



<h6 id="ripple-payments">Ripple Payments</h6>



<p>The RippleNet payment network is a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system created by Ripple Labs Inc. It enables institutions and organizations to start and run a high-performance business in the payment industry. With RippleNet, payments can be sent within three seconds and at a minuscule fee to any part of the world.</p>



<p>In the quest of building a secure payment solution, Ryan Fugger created the OpenCoin payment system in 2014, which later transformed to Ripple. The project started severe business in 2012 when Jed McCaleb and Chris Larson came on board. As of the beginning of 2021, hundreds of financial institutions worldwide use RippleNet to offer a satisfactory payment service to their customers.</p>



<p>Ripple&#8217;s current price is around $0.27 per coin. Hence, sitting at 5th place on the cryptocurrency ranking table with a market cap of about $12,386,155,167 behind Polkadot (DOT). DOT has an estimated market cap of $15,498,857,928. The top-ranked coins by market cap are in this order: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether USDT.</p>



<h3 id="ripple-xrp-price-chart"><strong>Ripple (XRP) Price Chart</strong></h3>

<h3 id="market-prediction-for-ripple-xrp-price-2021"><strong>Market prediction for Ripple (XRP) price 2021</strong></h3>



<p>We are all aware of how volatile the cryptocurrency market is. This nature of the market makes it difficult to make future price predictions of an asset with total certainty. Ripple predictions are no exception as it also demonstrates high volatility. With that being said, let&#8217;s look at what some experts have to say about the Ripple predictions for the year 2021. This will help us have a broader idea of the possible outcomes;</p>



<h4 id="dhf82-ripple-xrp-price-prediction-2021"><strong>DHF82 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2021</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DHF82-Ripple-Price-Prediction-20210A.jpg"  alt="DHF82 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2021"  class="wp-image-32476" ></figure>



<p>Per&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.tradingview.com/u/DHF82/" rel="noreferrer noopener">DHF82&#8217;s</a>&nbsp;analysis, XRP is gradually shifting to another accumulation phase after a contraction. In the accumulation phase, the XRP price will be moving up and down in a narrow channel for a while. The analyst believes this might be interrupted if Ripple Lab&#8217;s Security Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit is settled or Bitcoin makes a robust bullish move once again.</p>



<h4 id="will-meade-ripple-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Will Meade Ripple Price Prediction 2021</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/da2084e1-9924-411c-8551-5b9a51889e10"  alt="Will Meade Ripple Price Prediction 2021" ></figure>



<p>In July 2020, Will Meade, former PM at Goldman Sachs and billionaire hedge fund manager, bought his first crypto (XRP) and expected its value to rise with Bitcoin at ATH. He tweeted: &#8220;I made my first crypto purchase ever this week $XRP Ripple. I know very little about crypto, but I believe a rising tide lifts all boats, so if Bitcoin goes back to its all-time highs, then XRP should as well, and that would be a 15 bagger 1500%.&#8221;</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4 id="wallet-investor-ripple-xrp-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Wallet Investor Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2021</strong></h4>
</div></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Wallet-Investor-Ripple-Price-Prediction-20210A.jpg"  alt="Wallet Investor Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2021"  class="wp-image-32498" ></figure>



<p>Wallet Investor, an online forecast service for digital assets, had also made a bearish take on XRP&#8217;s future price, stating that XRP is a bad long-term investment. According to Wallet Investor, XRP is expected to trade at an average of $0.3 by the end of the year.</p>



<h4 id="longforecast-ripple-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Longforecast Ripple Price Prediction 2021</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Longforecast-Ripple-Price-Prediction-20210A.jpg"  alt="Longforecast Ripple Price Prediction 2021"  class="wp-image-32509" ></figure>



<p>According to Longforecast.com, Ripple price USD is expected to open at $0.22 in 2021 and close at $0.26 per coin. This is also another bearish stance on XRP&#8217;s future price prediction.</p>



<h4 id="tradingbeats-ripple-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Tradingbeats Ripple Price Prediction 2021</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Tradingbeats-Ripple-Price-Prediction-20210A.jpg"  alt="Tradingbeats Ripple Price Prediction 2021"  class="wp-image-32520" ></figure>



<p>TradingBeats is also forecasting XRP price USD at $0.34 by the beginning of February. Trading at an average price of $0.37 per coin by the end of 2021.</p>



<h3 id="ripple-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Ripple price prediction 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Ripple is undoubtedly undervalued at the moment in the crypto space because ripple price USD hasn&#8217;t made a massive upward move for some time now. Regardless, the project&#8217;s development is something we can&#8217;t deny. One of the most critical hurdles that might drawback the surge of Ripple&#8217;s current price is the current lawsuit by the SEC against the company. Once this is settled, we might see ripple coin prices appreciate over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to reports weeks ago, Gary Gensler, the former chairman of the Commodity Future Trading Commission (CFTC), might be chosen by President-elect Joe Biden to take over the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and people in the crypto space are anticipating he doesn&#8217;t interfere in the ongoing investigations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with <a target="_blank" href="https://fortune.com/2020/10/06/ripple-leaving-us-america-crypto-regulation-sec-chris-larsen/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortune</a> in October 2020, Chris Larsen. A senior executive at Ripple, commented on Ripple&#8217;s plan to relocate to a more crypto-friendly nation and named the UK and Singapore a possible destination for the company. He believes regulations in these countries are far more favorable than in the United States. </p>



<h6 id="more">More</h6>



<p>Besides all these obstacles, Ripple hasn&#8217;t deviated from its goal of creating a payment network to be used by financial institutions for cross-border payment at a competitive rate, speed, and maximum security. As of 2021, RippleNet is being utilized by over a hundred financial intuitions around the world. Some of its partners include JP Morgan, Banco Santander, and not forgetting big players like MoneyGram, and Standard Chartered. With the significant developments, Ripple&#8217;s current price is expected to change positively in the long term.</p>



<p>Bitrue digital asset exchange with its traditional investment service supports the staking of XRP for token holders. At the time of posting, users are getting an estimated annual percentage rate of 5.3%. This development might attract prospective investors and the entire XRP community, which will eventually affect ripple value.</p>



<h3 id="ripple-xrp-price-prediction-2025"><strong>Ripple XRP price prediction 2025</strong></h3>



<p>In the long term, Ripple&#8217;s current price is expected to appreciate by most analysts. At the same time, they consider the project&#8217;s fundamentals, which is still reliable and technical analysis. As stated earlier, measures are being put in place to settle the issue with the SEC. Ripple is working tirelessly to onboard more partners and introduce innovative financial products to streamline the business processes in the payment and remittance sector.</p>



<p>Some online prediction websites project the XRP value within the range of $0.50-$0.60 in the last quarter of 2025. In contrast to the bullish XRP price predictions, a popular asset prediction website also predicted XRP to close 2021 at $0.26 and steadily make an upwards move to the $0.10 &#8211; $0.12 range 2025.</p>



<p>CoinSwitch, on the other hand, predicted XRP price to reach $3 in 2023 and progress to touch $4.52 in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="ripple-price-prediction-verdict"><strong>Ripple price prediction verdict</strong></h3>



<p>Regardless of the countless troubles being experienced, Ripple places itself as one of the promising crypto projects today. Ripple is expected to expand its operations to new geographical areas and introduce innovative products for financial institutions. Just last week and despite the ups and downs. Ripple landed a strategic partnership with Malaysian e-wallet company Mobile Money and BKash, which will bring 10 million users into their platform.</p>



<p>Even though the short-term XRP prediction might be bearish, the future seems to be full of growth opportunities. XRP might be a good investment in the long term for investors wanting to diversify their portfolios and looking for assets. Recent ripple news indicates bullish sentiment around the asset. It is highly recommended that you make financial decisions such as investing in XRP based on the information you&#8217;ve personally found through researching various sources, including expert opinion, technical and fundamental analysis, market trends, etc.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 id="what-is-dash"><strong>What is DASH?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/what-is-dash-coin-1920x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-32565" ></figure>



<p>Dash, a decentralized protocol, built on the bitcoin core code, has unique features that enable it to process anonymous transactions. Apart from privacy, its transactions are faster, with negligible fees. This is possible because of its key features which include masternodes, InstantSend and PrivateSend.</p>



<p>Interestingly, Dash is an open protocol, meaning that no single entity or individual controls it. Besides, it has its own blockchain, infrastructure and wallet.</p>



<h2 id="history"><strong>History</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/history-of-dash.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34094" ></figure>



<p>&nbsp;Dash is a bitcoin fork with an amusing history. In fact,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/eduffield44">Evan Duffield</a>, a software developer and an enthusiast of the bitcoin, developed the Dash coin. This is after he studied the bitcoin for a long time and observed its weaknesses which include lack of privacy, high transaction costs and scalability problem.</p>



<p>As a result, the Dash team launched the Coin on 18 January 2014. Originally, they used the name XCoin (XCO). However, in February 2014 they changed the name to Darkcoin before they rebranded it to Dash (Digital Cash) on 25 March 2015.</p>



<h2 id="the-dash-coin"><strong>The Dash coin</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/the-dash-coin.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34083" ></figure>



<p>Dash is a popular digital currency which is easy to use. Accordingly, the developer hoped that the Dash coin would achieve the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto, of being an alternative to fiat currency.</p>



<p>The major reason for this is its fungibility. This means that two dash coins can replace each other, the way a $1 note can replace another $1 note with no hassles. Thus, Dash is a safe and convenient payment method. Above this, it is portable and divisible, with low transaction cost. With these qualities, Dash is a basic alternative to fiat money as people can easily use it when carrying out their everyday transactions. It is usable both online and in shops.</p>



<p>Since its inception in 2014, Dash experiences price volatility like many cryptocurrencies. When the crypto market is bullish, the coin responds in a related manner. If the market turns bearish, its prices go into a downtrend. Surprisingly, from its launch in 2014 until the end of 2016, its price was less than $10.</p>



<p>After 2016, it entered a bullish trajectory. According to Primexbt, it peaked at $1 540 on 20 December 2017. In contrast, during the bearish market of 2018, its price fell to $40 before it picked up at the end of 2019.&nbsp; In 2020, at some point, its price rose to $120. At the time of writing this article, the price of Dash is US$103.70, as per CoinDesk rate.</p>



<h2 id="features"><strong>Features</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/features-of-dash.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34105" ></figure>



<p>Dash has unique features which differentiate it from bitcoin in particular and other cryptocurrencies in general. The main features are InstantSend, PrivateSend and Masternodes.</p>



<p><strong>Masternodes:</strong>&nbsp;The Dash network mining system operates at two levels, masternodes and miners. The masternodes act as special servers that perform the most important functions on the Dash network. In particular, the masternodes handle PrivateSend, InstantSend and governance and treasury functionalities.</p>



<p><strong>InstantSend</strong>: Using the masternodes technology, Dash offers instant and secure transactions. The protocol completes a transaction within two seconds. This is because masternodes validate transactions immediately.&nbsp; It is not possible for a user to make two different payments using the same funds because there is immediate transaction finality. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PrivateSend:</strong>&nbsp;Users carry out anonymous transactions on the Dash network. Notably, Dash improved the Coinjoin feature responsible for enabling breaking up of denominations. In the end, the masternodes mix up these denomination components, obscuring the origin of the funds. Therefore, all transactions are 100% private.</p>



<p><strong>Chainlocks:</strong>&nbsp;This feature enables the Dash Network to have certainty and finality of transactions. Because payments are immediate, transaction risks are very low.</p>



<p><strong>Self-governing and funding</strong>: This is another unique feature of Dash. In the Bitcoin network, miners get 100% of the reward. However, this is different with Dash network, where 10% of the rewards goes back to Dash. Thus, the platform uses these funds to institute further development and growth of the Dash coin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, the Dash network uses a democratic means of allocating its funds. Community members vote on all developmental projects and allocation of funds. This is in line with the decentralization trend that exists in the crypto world.</p>



<h2 id="token-information"><strong>Token Information</strong></h2>



<p>By design, the total Dash coin supply is 18 million.</p>



<p>According to Primexbt, its current market cap is $655 million.</p>



<h2 id="nbsp-advantages-of-dash"><strong>&nbsp;Advantages of Dash</strong></h2>



<p>The discussion has already touched on some advantages of the Dash coin. These include:</p>



<ul><li>The user is in total control of his/her Dash coin and can transact with anyone around the world at any time.</li><li>All transactions are anonymous and instant, with no possibility of double spend.</li><li>Also, the transactions are irreversible, avoiding any potential fraudulent activities.</li><li>Above all, the Dash network offers security and speed transactions.</li></ul>



<h2 id="disadvantages"><strong>Disadvantages</strong></h2>



<p>The major disadvantages of Dash Coin include:</p>



<ul><li>The Dash coin is not yet universally acceptable. Some people and entities do not accept it as medium of exchange.</li><li>The coin is vulnerable to currency volatility, like most cryptocurrencies.</li><li>The focus is limited in nature, that of being a medium of exchange.</li></ul>



<h2 id="dash-community"><strong>Dash community</strong></h2>



<p>Because of the popularity of the Dash coin, Dash has got a large community. In order to cater for their informational needs, it has several social platforms, including:https://reddit.com/r/dashpay/</p>

<p>Managing to raise a whopping $257 million from crowd sale in September 2017,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/filecoin-wallet" rel="noreferrer noopener">Filecoin</a>&nbsp;has been building its products for the past three years and finally launched its Mainnet. The Filecoin team is working on creating a decentralized cloud storage and retrieval market, where anyone with free disk space could rent out to clients on the internet and, in return, receive rewards in the FIL token. Find out how Filecoin will revolutionize how data is stored and accessed in the coming years.</p>



<h3 id="what-is-filecoin"><strong>What is Filecoin</strong></h3>



<p>Filecoin is a peer-to-peer, decentralized file storage and sharing network that uses the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-blockchain" rel="noreferrer noopener">blockchain</a>&nbsp;to enable users to rent out their unused storage space in a transparent and reliable marketplace. The Filecoin protocol incentivizes miners to help clients store and retrieve data in a secure fashion.</p>



<p>Clients must pay using the FIL protocol token for data storage while the storage miners and retrieval miners earn FIL for offering store and serving data, respectively. All these integrated processes are executed without any central body&#8217;s involvement, which is contrary to that of the legacy file storage platforms.</p>



<h3 id="brief-history"><strong>Brief History</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/brief-history-of-filecoin-1920x668.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34328" ></figure>



<p>Filecoin was developed on top of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) by Planet Labs in 2017. The IPFS protocol is a peer-to-peer storage network that allows users to host and receive data via a distributed file system without any reward scheme.</p>



<p>Filecoin secured around $257 million in 2017 from its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) plus venture funding making it one of the largest token sales in the history of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-cryptocurrency" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryptocurrencies</a>. This drew a lot of attention from the mainstream media and hype around the project.</p>



<p>The project had gone through several stages of development until September 2020 where it launched its Mainnet. In less than a month after a successful Mainnet launch, Filecoin achieved a significant milestone. The network passed 1.1 million TB (terabytes) of storage capacity. According to reports, the network could store 4,500 Wikipedias, 290 million movies at 1080p quality, and 19 copies of the entire Internet Archive.</p>



<h3 id="filecoin-technology-amp-advantages"><strong>Filecoin Technology &amp; Advantages</strong></h3>



<p>Filecoin finds itself in a competitive environment and, as such, needs to bring something of value to the table. With giants in the business like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, Juan Benet, creator of Filecoin, had the vision to build from scratch a sophisticated marketplace for data storage and retrieval using the blockchain.</p>



<p>Centralized data storage solutions are prone to attacks due to their architecture, thus influencing Filecoin to adopt the blockchain to render a more secure and efficient storage service to consumers. The Filecoin protocol relies on four components to operate as intended. Some of the notable innovations and technologies being used by the Filecoin protocol are as follows:</p>



<h3 id="decentralized-storage-network-nbsp-dsn"><strong>Decentralized Storage Network&nbsp;(DSN)</strong></h3>



<p>The DSN scheme is one of the concepts introduced by Filecoin to enable independent storage providers to offer storage space and retrieval services with an incentive model. The Filecoin storage network uses verifiable markets (Storage &amp; Retrieval Markets) to ensure storage providers receive their payment for rendering a storage or retrieval service for a client.</p>



<p>The DNS gathers storage offered by several independent providers and coordinates without assistance from external entities to provide data storage and retrieval to clients.</p>



<h3 id="consensus-mechanism"><strong>Consensus Mechanism</strong></h3>



<p>Filecoin combines two unique consensus mechanisms to achieve its goal of creating a decentralized storage and retrieval network. Filecoin implements the Proof-of-Replication (PoRep) and Proof-of-Spacetime (PoSt)&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/academy/cryptocurrency-algorithm" rel="noreferrer noopener">algorithms</a>.</p>



<p>The PoRep deals with storage providers convincing their respective clients that they have stored replicas of the underlying data paid for their (data provider) physical storage. PoRep is a buildup of previous schemes that were likely to be exploited by malicious miners. PoRep is strategically designed to prevent Sybil, Outsourcing, and Generation attacks.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the Proof-of-Spacetime enables a user to confirm if the agreed term&#8217;s storage provider is storing the outsourced data. This mechanism was introduced because the Proof-of-Storage wasn&#8217;t effective in keeping track of how storage providers store long data.</p>



<h3 id="storage-and-retrieval-markets"><strong>Storage and Retrieval Markets</strong></h3>



<p>These are verifiable markets used to match and settle orders between clients and miners on the Filecoin network. The storage market allows clients to pay storage miners to store data, whereas the retrieval market allows clients to request data by paying retrieval miners to deliver it. Parties involved in a deal are free to set their price and accept offers they deem fit. Filecoin employs a network of full nodes to oversee exchange operations, and guarantees miners get rewarded for the services they render to clients.</p>



<h3 id="smart-contracts"><strong>Smart Contracts</strong></h3>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/smart-contracts" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smart contracts&nbsp;</a>on Filecoin enable users to code stateful programs to perform user-defined operations when certain conditions are met. The smart contract can perform market operations, proof verification, spend tokens, etc.</p>



<p>This has opened an opportunity for complex operations to be executed on the network without supervision. For example, a client could write a contract to reward a miner in a particular fashion. They can also create contracts to update data and several others.</p>



<h3 id="mining-on-filecoin"><strong>Mining on Filecoin</strong></h3>



<p>When used in the Filecoin ecosystem, the term mining is different from what is prevalent in other blockchains. Usually, miners on a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/proof-of-stake-vs-proof-of-work" rel="noreferrer noopener">Proof-of-Work</a>&nbsp;blockchain will be in charge of verifying transactions and securing the network. On the contrary, miners on the Filecoin network are responsible for storing, providing content, and issuing new blocks. FIlecoin miners will have to provide storage capacity to clients in need of disk space to store their data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There will be multiple types of miners on the Filecoin network, with each performing a specific function. Currently, the ones playing critical roles in the network are the storage miners and retrieval miners. The team also plans to implement repair miners in due course.</p>



<p>Storage miners are the heart of the network. They are responsible for two primary duties, i.e., storing data for clients while earning file coin (FIL) and computing cryptographic proofs to verify storage across time. Unlike other blockchains where earnings depend on hashing power, Filecoin miners receive block rewards and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/network-fees" rel="noreferrer noopener">transaction fees</a>&nbsp;proportional to the storage space they contribute to the network.</p>



<p>The role of the retrieval miners is to provide pipes for fast data retrieval by clients. Retrieval miners on the FIlecoin network receive rewards when they bid and win a particular file in addition to mining fees. They usually secure a deal with prospect clients based on their bandwidth, latency, and how close they are to the client. A retrieval miner will be able to make deals so long as it has enough capacity. The number of deals they can make depends on their maximum bandwidth.</p>



<h3 id="power-and-rewards"><strong>Power and Rewards</strong></h3>



<p>Every miner on the Filecoin network has a power value ascribed to it, and it is proportional to the storage capacity a miner contributes to the network. A better power value increases the chances of a miner being selected to mine a block in every epoch. And for mining blocks, miners earn block rewards and transaction fees for messages included in an underlying block.</p>



<h3 id="how-does-filecoin-work"><strong>How does Filecoin work</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="5334"  height="1855"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/what-is-filecoin.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34329"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/what-is-filecoin.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/what-is-filecoin.png 1024w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/what-is-filecoin.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/what-is-filecoin.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/what-is-filecoin.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/what-is-filecoin.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/what-is-filecoin.png 380w"  sizes="(max-width: 5334px) 100vw, 5334px" ></figure>



<p>Filecoin works similarly to the IPFS network, allowing users to share and store data with no incentive model. Clients pay miners to store their file, both miner and client reach a deal, and then the miner pledges to store the file and makes it public on the blockchain.</p>



<p>Filecoin then encrypts the data, chop them into chunks, and hosts them on the network. There is a perpetual verification mechanism to check if miners are doing what is expected of them. Filecoin verifies data being stored for the stipulated period using the Proof of Replication (PoRep) and Proof of Spacetime&#8221; (PoST) mechanism. Random miners are chosen to prove random data are still being stored.</p>



<p>In retrieving a file, clients will have to pay retrieval miners to get their request fulfilled.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="why-use-filecoin-storage-network"><strong>Why use Filecoin Storage Network</strong></h3>



<p>A user will opt for a cloud storage provider based on personal preference and factors, including reliability, cost, and speed. On the Filecoin network, users have more bargaining power as they can bargain with any miner. Clients have various parameters such as cost and speed to consider when choosing a miner to store their data. This makes pricing on the network very competitive. Users can continuously verify if their files are being adequately stored by miners they have struck a deal with.</p>



<p>On the side of storage providers, they have a way to monetize their free disk space by making deals, storing data, and in return receive rewards in FIL token. The system has been designed to reward miners proportional to their storage capacity. The more storage you add to the network, the more Filecoin you will earn.</p>



<h3 id="perspectives-and-takeaways"><strong>Perspectives and Takeaways</strong></h3>



<p>Filecoin is widely known for its decentralized cloud storage market and has been working hard, which could be seen on their GitHub page. With a significant increase in miners at various levels, from large-scale data centers to individuals with spare disk space, Filecoin is poised to democratize and decentralize how data is being stored on the web, thanks to its miners.</p>



<p>The launch of its Mainnet onboarded some web 2.0 based applications, which are now functioning as web 3.0 applications. Starling is one of the few projects currently in the development stage and working on using the Filecoin network to store information for long-term preservation. A wide range of applications will utilize the Filecoin network for their cloud storage needs as time goes on. Another example is the Livepeer decentralized video hosting platform that anyone can use to upload and share videos.</p>



<p>Filecoin is also working on using bridges to establish connections with other blockchains. The cross-chain interaction will allow applications on other blockchains to use Filecoin&#8217;s storage as most of these blockchains provide less storage capacity and are also costly. With bridges, Filecoin will bring storage and retrieval support to these platforms. On the other hand, Filecoin will also access some of the features and functionalities of other blockchains.</p>



<p>The last quarter of 2020 saw many projects tap into DeFi and Filecoin was no exception. In November 2020, Anchorage and Tokensoft teamed up to create a wrapped version of the FIL token to be used in popular DeFi applications like Compound, Maker, and Uniswap. This development will open doors for creative DeFi applications and create opportunities for members (Miners and clients) in the Filecoin ecosystem.</p>



<p>In December 2020, it was announced that Fenbushi Capital pledged an investment worth over $15 million to support development in the IPFS and Filecoin ecosystem. Fenbushi was one of the early investors and invested a significant amount in Filecoin&#8217;s public sale in 2017. Since then, it has been actively supporting many Chinese miners to partake in mining on the FIlecoin network by providing them with FIL tokens to stake. Fenbushi&#8217;s collaboration with Filecoin can be viewed as a long term strategic partnership to help the FIlecoin ecosystem with its Ecosystem Fund.</p>

<p><strong>How to store and manage FIL</strong></p>



<p>Because Filecoin launched its Mainnet not long ago, it has just a few wallets that support the native FIL token. It is also possible to store your FIL token on exchange platforms, but it is not recommended because you won&#8217;t have full control of your funds.</p>



<p>We made mention of the wrapped Filecoin (WFIL) earlier in this post. The Wrapped Filecoin is a 1:1 equivalent of Filecoin represented as an ERC-20 on the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/ethereum-wallet" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>&nbsp;network. It is compatible with any ERC-20 wallet. Atomic Wallet is one of the user-friendly wallets you can use to store and manage WFIL. Atomic is a non-custodial&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/cryptocurrency-wallet" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryptocurrency wallet</a>&nbsp;and, as such, grants users access to their private keys. This allows users to recover their wallets quickly.&nbsp;<strong>WalletConnect</strong>&nbsp;is an open-source protocol that enables mobile wallets to connect to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-are-dapps" rel="noreferrer noopener">decentralized applications</a>&nbsp;(dApps). Atomic Wallet has this feature embedded and allows users to connect to the most popular DeFi applications seamlessly.</p>

<p>USDT is a cryptocurrency asset otherwise known as&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/academy/what-are-stable-coins-2" rel="noreferrer noopener">stable coin (crypto asset backed 1:1 to any fiat currency peg, in this case, pegged to U.S. dollars</a>. It&#8217;s issued on the Bitcoin blockchain (using the Omni and Liquid Protocol), Ethereum, EOS, Tron, Algorand, Bitcoin Cash (Simple Liquid Protocol), and OMG blockchains. Each unit of USDT (i.e., one USDT) is backed by one U.S. Dollar held in the fiat reserve of Tether Limited and can be redeemed through the Tether Platform.</p>



<h3 id="brief-history"><strong>Brief History</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/history-of-usdt.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34129" ></figure>



<p>The stable coin&#8217;s whitepaper was first published in January 2014 by&nbsp;<em>J.R Willett.</em>&nbsp;Tether (USDT) was founded by&nbsp;<em>Brock Pierce, Craig Sellar, and Reeve Collins</em>&nbsp;in July 2014 under the name&nbsp;<em>Realcoin</em>. It was officially renamed to&nbsp;<em>Tether</em>&nbsp;on 20th November 2014. The first USDT tokens were issued on 6th October 2014, using the Bitcoin blockchain through Omni layer protocol.</p>



<p>USDT was first introduced on Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange for trading in January 2015. In September 2017, it was introduced onto Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token. It was later introduced to other blockchain protocols like Tron as TRC-20 token, EOS, Algorand, and others.</p>



<p>Following the debut launch on other blockchain protocols, it was introduced into multi-blockchain wallets like Atomic Wallet, which has a high-security protocol for securing user funds.</p>



<p>A group of investigative journalists in November 2017 claimed that both Bitfinex and Tether officials are of the same group of individuals. This is against Tether&#8217;s claims that both companies are separately run by different individuals. The paradise papers leak of 2017 supports this claim where named Bitfinex officials Philip Potter and Giancarlo Devasini were responsible for setting up Tether Holdings Limited in the British Virgin Islands in 2014.</p>



<p>According to Tether&#8217;s website, the Hong Kong-based Tether Limited is a fully owned subsidiary of Tether Holdings Limited. The current CEO of Tether is Jean-Louis Van Der Velde, who is also the current CEO of Bitfinex.</p>



<p>However, there have been errors in auditing the dollar reserve that Tether company claims to have in the company bank account in a 1:1 ratio to the USDT amount in circulation. The circulating supply of USDT is currently at 24,747,346,122 USDT billion according to coinmarketcap data, whereas; the audited report doesn&#8217;t show the availability of the circulating amount in the company fiat bank account. Tether confirms that the worth of assets from receivables, loans, third party affiliate entities, etc., will count to support the 24,747,346,122 USDT billion circulating supply of USDT. There are currently 25,531,104,623 USDT in total supply minted already, according to coinmarketcap data. The total supply exists across all the blockchain platforms used by Tether in issuing its USDT stable coin.</p>



<p>The company states that USDT is &#8220;backed by our reserves, which include traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities.&#8221;</p>



<h3 id="usdt-technology"><strong>USDT Technology:</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/usdt-technology.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34140" ></figure>



<p>Tether Holdings is the company behind USDT. The stable coin is available on these top three blockchains, including&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/bitcoin-explained" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Bitcoin Blockchain</em></a>&nbsp;(using omni layer and liquid protocol),&nbsp;<em>Ethereum Blockchain</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Tron Blockchain</em>. Other blockchains include EOS, Algorand, Bitcoin Cash (using Simple Liquid Protocol), and Omesigo (OMG).</p>



<p>These blockchains provide security to the transfer of USDT stable coins across exchanges and their users. For example, USDT was launched on the liquid protocol, a sidechain on Bitcoin blockchain to offer faster, confidential transactions and sophisticated multi-sig security.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How it Works</strong>: 1 USD: 1 USDT. This is a fiat-collateralized type of stable coin that is issued on request and burned to maintain the fiat reserve supply. Tether, the issuer behind the USDT stable coin, mints more USDT once demand grows and subsequently burns excessive supply of the crypto assets on decreased demand in order to stabilize the price with the fiat reserve supply. The USDT in circulation must correspond with the amount in the company fiat account.</p>



<h3 id="features-of-theter-usdt"><strong>Features of Theter (USDT)</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/usdt-features.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34151" ></figure>



<p><strong><em>Confiscation of Asset:</em></strong></p>



<p>One of the key features of USDT technology, apart from security, is the ability to freeze assets. Tether can freeze addresses having it&#8217;s USDT on any blockchain, which enables the platform to fight against money laundering, anti-terrorism, hacks, and illicit transfers.</p>



<p><strong><em>Stable Price</em></strong>:</p>



<p>This stable coin maintains a stable price all day, always. The price of each USDT whenever you buy or sell must remain $1 across any blockchain it was issued on. The token price doesn&#8217;t drop its value. This makes it possible to be sold at a dollar rate any time across other fiat currency pairs because it is pegged at a 1:1 ratio to the real fiat dollar asset. Tether, the issuing company behind USDT, is expected to have an equivalent of the amount of USDT in circulation in a bank account or assets.</p>



<p><strong><em>Multiple Blockchain</em>:</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stable coin is created across multiple blockchains, including; Omni,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-ethereum-blockchain" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>, Tron,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/how-to-activate-eos-account" rel="noreferrer noopener">EOS</a>, Algorand, Bitcoin Cash, and Omesigo (OMG). These blockchains provide easy accessibility of the token across multiple platforms popularly used in the crypto space. The token utilizes the technology and features available on these blockchains to ensure efficiency, accountability, and security for all users. For example, the launch of USDT on Bitcoin Cash using Simple Liquid Protocol will provide efficiency and security to the USDT ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Smart Contract Compatible</em>:</strong></p>



<p>USDT on Ethereum makes it compatible with&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/smart-contracts" rel="noreferrer noopener">smart contract functionalities.</a>&nbsp;Another top smart contract enabled blockchains to include EOS and Tron Blockchain. This is a good feature that allows the censorship of USDT tokens deployed on them. It can be used across&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-defi-complete-guide" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeFi (decentralized finance)</a>&nbsp;platforms, bringing the traditional finance type of interest on savings to the decentralized system. This allows projects to offer automated APY (Annual Percentage Yield) percentage on USDT staking on their platform under the DeFi ecosystem.</p>



<p><strong><em>Censorship</em></strong>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>All USDT tokens minted on any of these blockchains are censored. This means that users or investors who use these stable coins on any platform can risk freezing of their assets if any wallet is found defaulting, especially in cases of a hack involving USDT tokens on any of the chains it was created. Tether Holdings can freeze the address holding the assets by using smart contract functionalities or other features enabled on these chains to control the movement of this illegal funds transfer.</p>



<h3 id="advantages-of-theter-usdt"><strong>Advantages of Theter (USDT)</strong></h3>



<p>There are numerous reasons why USDT is the most widely adopted stable coin. The company has shown a reputable amount of trust and accountability in management, which puts it out there as the most reliable stable coin provider. There are other advantages which include;</p>



<ul><li><strong>It&#8217;s a stable coin:&nbsp;</strong>USDT will always remain 1:1 to real U.S. dollars. The token worth will forever remain $1, and it is not volatile.</li></ul>



<ul><li>It is a good hedge against the market volatility of the cryptocurrency market for cryptocurrency traders, allowing them to easily save funds in dollars, especially during bear markets and trading.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Fast Transaction</strong>: The transfer of this stable coin is fast and borderless. USDT has all the features of a cryptocurrency, which allows it to be transferred at the speed of its incumbent blockchain. For example, on Tron Blockchain, the transaction time is nearly instant. On Ethereum Blockchain, it usually takes 10-50 seconds.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Low Transaction Fee</strong>: There is near zero-fee transaction on Tron Blockchain and a reduced fee on transfer on Ethereum Blockchain and other blockchains compared to the traditional means of money transfer of USD.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Anonymity</strong>: The transactions are anonymous transactions, but users have custodial access to their funds.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Available Cash Reserve</strong>: There is always an equivalent cash of the stable coin USD Tether in the bank to support the cryptocurrency stable coin in circulation, thereby maintaining the stable price at a 1:1 ratio always.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Maintaining Tru</strong>st: There is always an audit report published frequently to maintain transparency to the users that the equivalent in circulation is available in the company&#8217;s fiat bank account.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Legally Compliant</strong>: It is legally compliant with regulatory bodies for all regions.</li></ul>



<h3 id="disadvantages-of-theter-usdt"><strong>Disadvantages of Theter (USDT)</strong></h3>



<p>There is a big disadvantage of stable coins like USDT when it comes to making sure that the amount in circulation is the equivalent amount at the bank account.</p>



<p>Considering that it is a stable coin, the company is bound to ensure that the cash reserve supporting the crypto asset is always available for redemption. The disadvantages, therefore, include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Stability Issues</strong>: If the cash reserve fails to correspond to the amount of the crypto asset (USDT) in circulation, the coin&#8217;s stability to U.S. dollars will be affected. It will no longer remain 1:1 to U.S. dollar peg.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Asset Control</strong>: There is no full ownership of funds synonymous with crypto assets like USDT. Tether, the company behind the stable coin, can freeze addresses found violating rules of the usage of the asset.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Trust Issues</strong>: An audit report taunting user confidence can lead to less adoption.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Asset Mismanagement</strong>: Failure to burn excess tokens to meet up with the amount in the reserve balance can lead to price instability and possible crash.</li></ul>



<h3 id="key-perspective-and-takeaways"><strong>Key Perspective and Takeaways:</strong></h3>



<p>According to coinmarketcap data, there are over 19,634,648,391 USDT in circulation now, and the current market capitalization of the stable coin puts it at the fourth position. There is no limit to the supply that will forever exist because it is pegged to a fiat currency. Fiat currencies do not have a limited supply.</p>



<p>Currently, the market capitalization is $19,645,436,944 USD. Binance cold wallet is the number-one holder of the stable coin capped at $3,472,095,731 on Tron protocol Blockchain while Huobi is the second-largest holder also on Tron capped at 1,309,358,376 according to the rich list provided on Tether website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The highest amount of the USDT stable coin currently minted on any blockchain lies on Ethereum Blockchain, followed by Tron Blockchain. The company behind the stable coin also has launched other stable coins under its reserve: Euro Tether (EURt), Offshore Chinese Yuan Tether (CNHt), and Gold Tether (XAUt). All of these assets are pegged 1:1 to the corresponding fiat and asset value (gold), respectively.</p>



<p>USDT stands out as the most reliable stable coin among other stable coins in the market. The first stable coin is issued in cryptocurrency and one of the most regulatory compliant, stable coins.</p>
