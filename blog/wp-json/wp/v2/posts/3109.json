The main idea is to make service that allows optimizing business processes via decentralized apps (which are also abbreviated as dApps) and smart contracts. It is executed by combining both private and public technologies with several major features:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The Dragonchain Platform \u2014 a kind of the backend part of the blockchain designed to be private so companies can store secured data important for a business. It also allows developing unique smart contracts using common programming languages like Java, Python, C or Node. The Platform is also connected to Amazon Web Services for enterprise purposes.<\/li><li>The Dragonchain Marketplace \u2014 a system of client support that consists of experts in crypto, blockchain, marketing and software development. This aspect also serves as a repository for pre-set smart contracts that a company can use.<\/li><li>The DragonChain Crowd-Scaled Incubator \u2014 a program of supporting start-ups that gives young teams an opportunity to easily develop a blockchain project and gain market value quick.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole platform is fueled by its native token called the Dragon Coin or DRGN. It is a micro-licensed cryptocurrency serving as a transition asset for all the platform features. It works on a sophisticated system that includes 5 different levels of verifications by different participants. This technology ensures higher security for dApps and smart contracts deployed on the platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, the project was developed by the world media giant Disney in 2014. It was designed as an internal blockchain service for enterprise use. But later, in 2016, its code was released as an open-source, and the project transformed into an independent company \u2014 The Dragonchain Foundation. Initially, the project was a non-profit organization, but after some time was reorganized as a commercial one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of this writing, DRGN is listed on many exchanges including Gate.io, KuCoin, Tidex and CoinExchange.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"dragonchain-wallet\">Dragonchain Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your crypto wisely!
