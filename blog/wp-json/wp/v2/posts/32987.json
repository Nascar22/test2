Its proprietary ADA token followed in the autumn of 2017, entering the market for $0.0130.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cardano network is built on genuinely revolutionary blockchain technology, with its multilayered architecture and protocols underpinned by core mathematical principles and in-depth, peer-reviewed research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ADA coin is pivotal to the network&#8217;s settlement layer, which is fully operational and allows users to send and receive tokens between wallets (we&#8217;ll have a little more on this later). Now that the computational layer is reaching maturity and beginning to underpin various smart contracts and commercial partnerships, the demand for ADA coins is thriving.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This surge in demand is reflected by the ADA coin price, which broke through the $1 barrier in January 2018 for the first time and, after correcting, has spent three years looking to get back there. July 2020 saw some price growth after about a year of little activity, but it wasn&#8217;t really until November 2020 that saw Cardano become hot property. As of February 9th, we have now seen Cardano&#8217;s tip of $0.71, from a year start of $0.18, offering impressive results to early investors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this may be lower than the ADA all-time price high of $1.33 achieved on January 4th, 2018, it should be noted that this occurred in the crypto bull market that followed Bitcoin&#8217;s historic price run in 2017. The ADA price subsequently crashed by around 90% to $0.14 in early April 2019.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current growth trend appears to be far more sustainable, so there has arguably never been a better time to hold ADA coins and manage these as part of your portfolio in the Atomic Wallet.&nbsp;<strong><em>But what&#8217;s our ADA price prediction and outlook for 2021 and beyond?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-cardano-ada\">What is Cardano (ADA)?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a subtle distinction between Cardano and ADA. The former is the name of an overarching blockchain protocol, and the latter refers to the cryptocurrency that&#8217;s widely traded on exchanges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cardano blockchain began its journey back in 2015, under Charles Hoskinson&#8217;s guidance (who played a prominent role in developing the Ethereum network) and Jeremy Wood.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017, Hoskinson also became the CEO of IOHK, which subsequently built Cardano&#8217;s unique blockchain and helped launch the ADA token into the cryptocurrency marketplace. Hoskinson utilized his skills and experience as a mathematician to create the network&#8217;s key point of difference, embodied by a mathematically driven consensus mechanism that&#8217;s incredibly secure and (most importantly) scalable. There&#8217;s no doubt that the core functionality of Cardano is based on the ADA coin, which can be used to process real-time exchanges and transactions&nbsp;<strong><em>or&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong>held as a secure store of wealth over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A maximum of 45 billion ADA tokens was made available to users at the time of launch, with the current circulation estimated to be slightly north of 31 billion. Approximately 16% of this haul went to the project&#8217;s founders at the outset, of course, with the remaining 84% split amongst various investors following a protracted and highly successful $4 billion ICO in early 2017.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cardano is currently a total market capitalization of $21 billion, with this having increased from $600 million following the asset&#8217;s debut. Like the ADA price, this is considerably lower than the $33 billion peaks in January 2018, but it has continued to enjoy marked and sustained growth since Q4 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"the-cardano-price-chart\">The Cardano Price Chart<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"the-market-prediction-for-cardano-price-2021\">The Market Prediction for Cardano Price 2021<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The above chart certainly highlights the sharp upward price trajectory enjoyed by the network and its ADA coin during the last 12 weeks, with demand continuing to soar on the back of positive Cardano news stories and significantly higher rates of adoption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what will the remainder of 2021 have in store for the ADA price? Here&#8217;s a selection of the most trusted and considered ADA price predictions for the year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"coinpedia-8217-s-cardano-price-prediction-2021\">Coinpedia&#8217;s Cardano Price Prediction 2021<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The outlook is certainly bright, according to Coinpedia, which has forecast that the current ADA price growth will continue throughout 2021. According to the crypto experts, it&#8217;s almost certain to record a new all-time high during this period, while the token could be priced as high as $3.50 by the end of the year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"walletinvestor-com-8217-s-cardano-price-prediction-2021\">Walletinvestor.com&#8217;s Cardano Price Prediction 2021<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Walletinvestor.com is renowned for utilizing AI-generated technical analysis, which typically produces more bearish and less tangible price predictions. In the case of Cardano and the ADA price, the expert predicts a sharp decline to as low as $0.157 during the first half of 2021, before a late surge that leaves the token valued somewhere between $0.273 and $0.402.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"long-forecast-8217-s-cardano-price-prediction-2021\">Long Forecast&#8217;s Cardano Price Prediction 2021<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Long Forecast website, the ADA price could be poised to break the $2 barrier by the end of 2021. This is a relatively bullish price prediction, with steady growth being forecast throughout the year. By December, the ADA price could range somewhere between $1.85 and $2.30, with annual growth of up to 532% predicted over the course of the next 11 months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"digitalcoinprice-com-8217-s-cardano-price-prediction-2021\">DigitalCoinPrice.com&#8217;s Cardano Price Prediction 2021<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>DigitalCoinPrice is also forecasting consistent growth through 2021, although this expert sees the ADA price appreciating much more steadily than many contemporaries. It sees the token trading at an average price of $0.62 in the months ahead, although the higher end of its forecast could see the token breach the $1 mark for the first time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"tradingbeast-8217-s-cardano-price-prediction-2021\">TradingBeast&#8217;s Cardano Price Prediction 2021<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We close with another relatively bullish Cardano price prediction, with TradingBeasts estimating that the token could see its average value reach $0.830845 by December 2021. At this time, the coin&#8217;s maximum price could trade as high as $1.0385618, while even the minimum forecast of $0.7062220 may offer appeal to investors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ada-price-prediction-2021\">ADA Price Prediction 2021<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While there&#8217;s quite a diverse mix of opinions concerning the precise ADA price prediction for 2021, there&#8217;s an overwhelming consensus that the coin is expected to enjoy broadly consistent growth over the course of the next 11 months, at least. Cardano&#8217;s ADA token has already been appreciated by more than 100% since February 1st. The network upgraded its delegation interface on Daedalus and became the focus of several positive news stories online and across social media channels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One particular Cardano news item reported the successful launch of a smart contract on its testnet. Simultaneously, the network&#8217;s high-profile partnerships with IBM and PriceWaterhouseCoopers (both of which were announced in January) have also generated a significant buzz and increased demand for the ADA token online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the similarities between Cardano and the Ethereum networks, the former could also benefit from the latter&#8217;s continued struggles with increased congestion and high gas fees (which are becoming synonymous with first and second-generation blockchains across the board). This opportunity is based on Cardano&#8217;s immense scalability and the ADA token&#8217;s capacity for staking, which may also underpin long-term price growth through 2025.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ada-price-prediction-through-2025\">ADA Price Prediction Through 2025<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The ADA price predictions through 2021 provide a clear consensus for consistent but variable growth, while it appears as though this trend will continue over the next five years or so.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the bullish end of the ADA price prediction for 2025, Coinpedia is forecasting that the token could break the $10 barrier during this period. This is mainly built on the long-term potential and scalability of the more comprehensive Cardano network, which could also send the price towards the $8 mark by the end of 2022.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, other forecasts are far more bearish, with CoinSwitch predicting that Cardano may not break the $2 barrier until some time in 2023. By 2025, it forecasts that the ADA price will touch $3, as it weighs the scalability and unique premise of the network&#8217;s protocols against the potential for increased competition from similar, third-generation blockchains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ADA price prediction through 2025 may also depend in part on the performance of the USD dollar. Make no mistake; the ADA price USD rate increase has been driven in part by the devaluation of the greenback through 2020, so this is something for investors to bear in mind going forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"our-cardano-price-prediction-verdict\">Our Cardano Price Prediction Verdict<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The key takeaway here is clear; while Cardano is an undeniably interesting investment option and one that&#8217;s poised for relatively consistent growth through 2025, there remains a diversity of opinion about how much the asset&#8217;s price will grow during this period.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our expert&#8217;s ADA price predictions suggest that the token could be priced anywhere between $0.273 and $3.50 by the end of 2021 alone. By 2025, the high-end price forecasts range between $3 and $10, with factors such as increased market competition and USD price fluctuations representing key variables in this respect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you also consider Cardano&#8217;s current price point and immense potential as a third-generation blockchain, the asset arguably offers optimal value as a long-term investment option. This is also borne out by the network&#8217;s much-publicized Ouroboros Hydra protocol, which allows Cardano to scale considerably over time and maintain its capacity for instantaneous transactions even as its user base swells. According to some reports, the Hydra protocol could scale to handle more than one million transactions per second overtime, eclipsing even established existing payment solutions such as Visa in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This type of Cardano protocol could certainly drive sustained price growth beyond 2025, so now may be the ideal time to invest in ADA and store the coin in your Atomic Wallet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-buy-the-ada-coin\">How to Buy the ADA Coin<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While you can&#8217;t currently buy ADA tokens on the Atomic Wallet, this is one of the best resources for storing, exchanging, and staking the token.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, once you&#8217;ve identified the platforms that&nbsp;<strong><em>do<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;sell ADA coins at the most competitive rates of exchange, you can transfer these directly into your Atomic Wallet and benefit from this platform&#8217;s incredible level of security. You can also manage your ADA coins alongside more than 300 alternative tokens, including market-leading entities such as Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Atomic Wallet also allows for staking, which refers to the process of earning cryptocurrency by merely holding it (which is ideal given the long-term appeal of Cardano) and delegating tokens to validators who approve transactions. You can currently stake Cardano and earn an ROI of up to 5.1% through transactions on the Atomic Wallet, providing a steady return to investors in the process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-exchange-ada-coins\">How to Exchange ADA Coins?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Atomic Wallet also benefits from some genuinely competitive exchange rates, which is ideal if you intend to branch out into other cryptocurrencies in the relatively bullish marketplace that exists at present. Aside from this and the sheer range of alternative tokens supported by the Atomic Wallet, you can exchange coins instantly and benefit from the most competitive rates in real-time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This particular advantage is at least partially driven by Atomic Wallet&#8217;s advanced backend system, which can also aggregate data from a diverse range of trusted sources and deliver this information accurately in real-time. This can encourage more informed decision making over time, which is pivotal in a fast-paced marketplace such as cryptocurrency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a final note, Atomic is also the first decentralized wallet to launch a membership program on the back of its native AWC token. All customers holding AWC tokens will receive rewards for using the platform&#8217;s built-in exchange service, with the precise amount of cashback on offer depending on your membership tier (including Blue, Silver, Gold, and Platinum).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To participate in this scheme, you&#8217;ll need to buy and hold a minimum of 100 AWC (1,000 AWC tokens will be required for Platinum membership). Then, exchange this with BNB or on Binance Dex as required. This is then available to be exchanged with any asset in Atomic Wallet (including ADA), with the total value of cashback counted on your AWC-BNB balance).&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"While Cardano was founded way back in 2015, this third-generation blockchain network didn&#8217;t officially launch until two years&hellip;\n","protected":false},"author":16,"featured_media":34295,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[203],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.4.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Cardano Price Prediction &amp; Forecast for 2021<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"What does 2021 have in store for the Cardano price, and what trends will drive its movements?
