The all-time high of ETN price was $0,2362 on the 2nd of November, 2017, shortly after the ICO. The all-time low occurred on November 25, 2019, when the rate dropped to the mark of $0,00308. The current market cap of the coin is $36 421 375 making ETN the coin \u2116 90 in CoinMarketCap\u2019s rating. The supply in circulation is 9 918 351 152 ETN with the maximum possible supply of 21 billion coins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ETN price experienced severe fluctuation at the dawn of its life in the period from fall 2017 to April 2018. Since then, the coin has been facing two modest peaks in the first days of May 2018 and September 2018. 2019 was the year of sideways trading for the coin without significant blasts. It\u2019s remarkable that the ETN price compared to BTC has been slowly decreasing throughout 2019 when its USD value was stable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"electroneum-etn-news\">Electroneum (ETN) News<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"electroneum-numerous-partnerships\">Electroneum Numerous Partnerships<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018 and 2019 Electroneum started joint work with several mobile providers, IT companies and non-governmental organizations in different parts of the world.

All these events support Electroneum reputation and price. The project also got support from world-known fiat-to-crypto services such as Indacoin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"partnership-with-xius\">Partnership with XIUS<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another milestone for Electroneum was signing a partnership agreement with XIUS. It is a telecommunication giant and a sub-brand of the USA\u2019s Megasoft. At this point, Electroneum is integrated with a payment system that connects 6 continents and runs 1 billion worth transactions each month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"electroneum-etn-price-predictions\">Electroneum (ETN) Price Predictions<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"coinnunce\">Coinnunce<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Coinnunce crypto portal is quite positive about Electroneum price prediction.

According to their technical analysis, the ETN rate will be $1.10 by December 2020. This article also marks wide support from community, strong competence in the project\u2019s field and technical features of the Electroneum blockchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"electroneum-etn-price-prediction-verdict\">Electroneum (ETN) Price Prediction Verdict<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before making any statements it\u2019s important to mention that cryptocurrency investments always is followed by financial risks. That\u2019s why it\u2019s making own research is a must. Our article is not financial advice for your investments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Electroneum seems to be a strong project with a bright future. It is a verdict supported by several factors:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Strong market positions. The company conquers quite new to crypto sphere making big steps in gathering attention and net worth.<\/li><li>Supportive community. The numbers of users and downloaded app speak for themselves \u2014 Electroneum is a project that people want to follow.<\/li><li>On-the-edge tech background. The team behind Electroneum develops its own ideas \u2014 both software and hardware.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the reasons ETN should be noticed and considered as an investment option. It has performed quite well during its lifespan despite all the crypto market downfalls and likely to keep on rising high.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-electroneum-etn\">What is Electroneum (ETN)?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Electroneum is a blockchain-based project locating in Great Britain. It is developed as a payment platform for mobile devices and focused on bringing crypto to mass adoption in the world of smartphones. The team behind Electroneum has an aim on making its native coin ETN a quick and easy payment method for all that means money transferring on phones and tablets. This includes mobile games, gambling, phone checkout and person-to-person money transactions. The platform is expanded into its own mobile app and low-budget Android smartphone designed to work in Electroneum\u2019s ecosystem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Electroneum project was created in early 2017 by a SiteWizard co-founder Richard Ells who also takes a chief position in the company. After a period of development and promotion, it initiated the public ICO sale in September 2017. It raised $40 million in ETH worth. At that point, 29% of the total supply was sold. As of this article making in December 2019, there is already 43% of maximum supply in circulation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project also aims at the target community of people who don\u2019t have bank accounts and have difficulties with transactions and online payments. Statistics say that there are 1.3 billion unbanked people in the world. This is one of the main reasons the Electroneum team finds it reasonable to fight for improving adoption for crypto.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another feature of this project is its full accordance with the AML\/KYC world standards. It is a necessary measure for making Electroneum a major player through partnerships with mobile providers and world IT giants. This might seem a contradiction to a privacy concept of cryptocurrency but as of this writing, there are already over 2.7 million registered accounts in the Electroneum base. It is a figure that may be big enough for considering integration with worldwide mobile companies like Google or Apple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"electroneum-etn-technical-features\">Electroneum (ETN) Technical Features<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally Electroneum was built as a Monero\u2019s soft fork, but shortly after that, it went to a hard fork when moved to its own code. It is, in fact, a fusion of some Monero\u2019s features with some changes. For example, Electroneum blockchain uses the same Ring Fence technology to make transaction fully anonymous through hiding recipient\u2019s and sender\u2019s addresses along with the amount transferred. The platform also applies a unique technology of disruptive blockchain that protects the system from 51% attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, ETN is mined with the same technology as Monero which is called CryptoNight. It is a Proof-of-Work mining algorithm. But Electroneum avoids ASIC mining and encourages CPU mining making it possible to use nodes with modest calculating power. On top of that, the company applies its own mining algorithm called PoR, or Proof-of-Responsibility. It is a program involving selected non-governmental organizations all over the globe with their computers as validator nodes. The main point of this feature is to enhance charity in underdeveloped countries by letting the NGOs get block rewards. Another way a user can get ETN is virtual mining featured in their official mobile app for Android and iOS. It doesn\u2019t mean that the coin can be mined with smartphones, but users can be rewarded for blockchain maintaining. As of this writing, the mobile app has 1.7 million downloads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saying more about the Electroneum mobile app it must be noticed that it is designed as an ETN wallet with transaction function. It also features creating offline wallets in order to provide better security. The wallet has security measures similar to ones that Monero and many other crypto projects apply \u2014 encrypting public keys and strict storage of private ones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Electroneum blockchain also has a focus on providing advantages over major cryptocurrencies by offering low fees and fast transactions. The average charge for a transaction is 0.2 ETN, and blocks are created in a period around one minute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-buy-and-store-electroneum-etn\">How to Buy and Store Electroneum (ETN)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a critical thing about crypto investments. If you want to enter the crypto game you need a tool for storing and managing your portfolio.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Atomic wallet is a modern service that can provide anything you need to own coins. It is a decentralized crypto wallet supporting over 300 coins and tokens. It has desktop apps for Windows, Mac, Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora and smartphone apps for Android and iOS. Atomic is fast, comprehensive and free to download.
