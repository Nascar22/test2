The team members present on the discussion with our community were Thuc Vu (CEO and Co-Founder) and William Ryan (Community Relations Manager).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the essential points of the AMA session:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please welcome Thuc (T), William (W) and the questions from our Telegram chat members (Q).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"kambria-and-its-project\">Kambria and its project<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Q: The KAMBRIA global innovation fund is something never seen in any other project before. What is the longevity plan of this innovation fund and who can access it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>W: Kambria&#8217;s global innovation fund is very unique. While generally reserved for researchers in Universities and small enterprises with a particularly interesting proposal, we do not have a strict limitation on this. It&#8217;s all done on a case by case basis. Our goal is to support researchers who are eager to develop new technologies, and when their research is complete, the technology will be openly available for the world to use on our platform. This not only drives innovation but ensures that important technology is not lost &#8211; and that everyone can benefit from the researchers&#8217; work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oftentimes, especially in University research programs,&nbsp; the research and development end up lost. Everyone is &#8220;recreating the wheel&#8221; so to speak, and no one is sharing technology for the benefit of the whole. We call these silos. We believe in open source platforms, as collaboration drives innovation. If we can support researchers&#8217; work and in turn, offer that technology to others, everyone wins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q: Solutions to apply blockchain technology to AI and in-depth have been proposed by many projects but not very effectively.&nbsp; Does Kambria have any outstanding technological solution to change that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>T: We utilize the blockchain to re-imagine how people could work together to develop these new technologies. So in other words, we tackle the problem of collaborations and invent a new model of open innovation, which is the key to how new technology can be developed in a more effective and efficient way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q: Most investors just focus on the price of the token in the short term instead of the real value of the project. Can you tell us the motivation and benefits for investors to Kambria Network for the long term?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>T:&nbsp; it is a delicate and difficult balance to maintain between the long term value of the project and the price of the token in the short term. We strongly believe in the long term value and have been focusing 110% on building out products and our ecosystem. But this made our token price suffer. We are listening to all the feedback and taking strong measures to address these issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q: As the first decentralized open innovation platform for AI and Robotics, how are you coping with the pressure of being pioneers and what are you doing to stay atop and maintain relevance?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>W: That is the beauty of what we are trying to build. We do not view other AI and Robotics companies as &#8220;competitors,&#8221; but rather, we invite them to work with us to achieve more. We are an open platform, and they can only benefit from working with us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are actively looking for competitive startups and enterprises to work with us. We have already been in discussions with major recognizable tech companies who are eager to develop relationships with us. There is plenty to build &#8211; no one company can build everything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q: I noticed that Kambria has been organizing hackathons at universities like UC Berkeley, Stanford and several other major schools in North America. Why are hackathons important to Kambria?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>T: Hackathon is a part of the Open Innovation Initiatives that we launch to get talents to join our platform, to jumpstart projects that corporates interested in, and to connect developers with the corporates. One successful example is the Vietnam AI Grand Challenge, in which we have 1000+ people participated in our workshops and events, 100+ teams compete in the hackathons, and we got a large corporate in Vietnam, Viet Thai International, to invest in and acquire some teams coming out of the hackathons already.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"kambria-in-its-use-cases\">Kambria in its use cases<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Q: What is the role of Kambria tokens in the network? Does the payment need to pay for Kambria? Do I need to pay for Kambria to send a message? What is the Kambria token appreciation logic?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>W: We use KAT to facilitate the transfer of value for every aspect of the Kambria Platform. In short, you cannot use any feature on our platform without owning the token (even the free ones! You still have to at least HODL KAT in your wallet to access free functionality)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a natural consequence, as we continue to grow our developer and enterprise community, the utility and demand for the token will be driven up. While still in the early stages, through our events and partnerships with universities and enterprise companies, interest in the platform and the developer community are consistently growing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are also working on additional ways to create utility for the token, including a staking model which allows community members to stake their KAT towards their favorite projects building on Kambria, and being able to earn rewards as a result.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"q-what-is-the-greatest-value-of-kambria\">Q: What is the greatest value of Kambria?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>T: The greatest value of Kambria is composed of:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>An open innovation platform that allows developers to collaborate and create new advanced technologies and connect them to corporates that need those technologies;<\/li><li>A strong developer community that we help attract and train through various hackathon and educational programs;<\/li><li>A game-theoretic approach to protect the IPs that are created on Kambria when they are being applied in the real world.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"kambria-in-its-partnerships\">Kambria in its partnerships<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Q: Who are the strategic partners of the Kambria Network? How are they helping the Kambria ecosystem?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>W: We have a growing list of strategic partners including a couple of major partnership programs that we are soon to announce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q: Seeing that you already have several strong partners, how does your team take into consideration all of their contributions when it comes to developing your goals further?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>T: We have different types of partners that contribute differently to our development. Corporate partners provide use cases and demand-driven technology projects. Universities and research labs provide talent pool and new tech. Governments provide public movement and policy supports. Each of them will have different attributions\/rewards as the projects get developed and deployed. We have to say that though we are very developer-centric. So whatever we do is to build a strong developer community and keep them happy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q: When do you think Kambria robots can be developed in Vietnam and serve the lives of Vietnamese people?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>T: We are already developing new robots in Vietnam for our corporate partners in the F&amp;B industry. Hopefully, you will see them running around serving food or coffee soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q: Who are Kambria&#8217;s partners now and in the future?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>T: Kambria has strong partnerships with top universities, government agencies and leading companies around the world such as Toppan, Stanford University, Carnegie Mellon University, #Hashed, Silicon Valley Robotics, TomoChain and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q: Despite the 20% drop in the price of Bitcoin, the Chinese market interest had a 100% growth. Why did you choose to focus on the Vietnam market?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>T: We focused first on the Vietnam market because of our strong connections with the government, large corporates and developer communities. These are essential ingredients for us to create a strong ecosystem. And one more key reason is that several of our team are Vietnamese. We are passionate about helping to build something meaningful there. However, China is definitely on the roadmap. In fact, we will announce something early next year about this. Please stay tuned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q: Currently, Vietnam has more than 30 new companies that work in artificial intelligence with Viettel, FPT and Vingroup invested in research and application. However, data accessibility remains a big problem for developers. What contributions can Kambria offer to solve this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>T: You are absolutely right. Data accessibility has been a big issue in Vietnam. Even though the government is very supportive in create and curate public datasets. We still don&#8217;t have good datasets to train machine learning software. Kambria is launching a data labeling bounty project early next year to get our community to help out with creating the new labeled dataset. We&#8217;ll start small with some computer vision dataset. But if all goes well, we will start working on other spaces such as healthcare or finance. Please, stay tuned for more details soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were glad to host <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KambriaNetwork\">Kambria Network<\/a> on our Telegram.
