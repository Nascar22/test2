The circulating supply is 17,000,000 SKY, while the total supply is 25,000,000 SKY. The daily trading volume is around $1,334,089 or 153.89390783 BTC. Skycoin is trading on several major markets, yet the most active exchange that trades SKY is Binance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-time high of Skycoin, $53.83, was reached on Dec 30, 2017 &#8211; during the most famous cryptocurrency bull-run of Winter 2017-2018. On the other hand, the all-time low of SKY, $0.384555, occurred not long ago on Jan 14, 2020. Currently, the estimated ROI (return on investment) of Skycoin is -43.37%, which means that $100 worth of SKY bought at the time of the Skycoin launch would not yield any profit today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most recent price trend of Skycoin appears to be slightly positive. Even though in 24 hours, the price of SKY fell by -13.86%, the 7-day price dynamics show an 11.62% increase in the price of SKY. Nevertheless, the price predictions for Skycoin are usually quite pessimistic. According to WalletInvestor, Skycoin is a bad long-term investment. In one year from now, the price of SKY may be as low as $0.124, which is a 3.5-fold decrease. However, it has to be noted that price manipulations are possible due to the low market cap of the coin, so one should be careful when investing in Skycoin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-skycoin-sky\">What is Skycoin (SKY)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Skycoin (SKY) is an open-source, community-owned, hardware-based peer-to-peer blockchain platform that leverages the incentive structure of the blockchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project team markets the platform as &#8216;completely secure, infinitely scalable, and ISP independent&#8217;.
