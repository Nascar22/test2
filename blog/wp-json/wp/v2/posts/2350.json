The circulating supply is 5,209,200,000 RVN, while the maximum supply is 21,000,000,000 RVN. The daily trading volume is around $15,896,643. The most active exchange that trades Ravencoin is Binance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-time high of Ravencoin, $0.080258, was reached not long ago on June 3, 2019 &#8211; outside the most famous cryptocurrency bull-run of winter 2017. On the other hand, the all-time low of Ravencoin, $0.009506, occurred the same year on February 6, 2019. Currently, the estimated ROI (return on investment) of RVN is -13.28%, which means that $100 worth of RVN bought at the time of the Ravencoin launch would not yield any profit today.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project was launched in late 2017, and the ICO was held in January 2018, during the major bull trend and popularity of the cryptocurrency market. Having entered the market at the price of around $0.02, Ravencoin quickly gained popularity, which made the price reach twice the initial value in just a couple of weeks. The history of RVN price is quite a dynamic one, with more peaks in 2018 and 2019 than the majority of cryptocurrencies had had. Ever since Ravencoin&#8217;s launch, 2018 was quite successful for RVN. Another major peak occurred in October 2018, when the price went up to $0.05 following the listing on CryptoBridge \u0438 Nanex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What happened afterward was the dominance of the bearish trend on the cryptocurrency market, and Ravencoin could not avoid its influence. Like many other altcoins, Ravencoin was caught in a downtrend soon after March, but in the middle of the year regained its strength and moved to the phase of steady growth.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the beginning of 2019, Ravencoin was trading at a price lower than $0.01. A dramatic increase to $0.07 occurred around April, and already in June, Ravencoin reached a historical high of $0.08. The price dynamics of Ravencoin often reveals aggressive growth behavior, when the price growth by 30% overnight (this happened in March 2018).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a hard fork of Bitcoin, Ravencoin (RVN) is unsurprisingly dependent on the price and market dynamics of BTC. RVN peaked at 400% its initial price back in March 2019; however, it is still talked about a lot in the crypto-community. Despite the fact that the mining difficulty of RVN is constantly increasing, it is getting more popular among miners, as well as traders.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the coin is considered a good investment by the majority of experts, because the strength of the underlying technology is undoubtful. One of the main future milestones for Ravencoin is to get listed on all the major exchanges; this is surely expected to boost its price. The rate of adoption and diversification of the applications for RVN may also contribute to its strengthening in the next 2-4 years. According to Changelly, a realistic forecast for Ravencoin price in 2020 is $0.3-0.4 per coin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-ravencoin-rvn\">What is Ravencoin (RVN)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ravencoin is a blockchain and decentralized ledger platform optimized for transferring assets, such as cryptocurrency tokens, between users or holders. Ravencoin is essentially a hard fork of Bitcoin, meaning it was built following the extensive development testing and improvement of the UTXO model of the Bitcoin protocol.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the key resulting differences include a decrease in block reward time down to only one minute, a change in the number of coins issued, the possibility to add custom assets, and messaging capabilities. Ravencoin is a free, open-source platform. All Ravencoins (RVN) are fairly issued and publicly mined in a transparent way using the x16r Proof-of-Work (PoW) hash algorithm created specifically for Ravencoin.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no private or public, founder, or developer allocation set aside. Ravencoin prioritizes user privacy, control, security, and censorship resistance. It is open for use and development in any jurisdiction while also providing additional custom features for users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"ravencoin-wallet\">Ravencoin Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your crypto wisely!
