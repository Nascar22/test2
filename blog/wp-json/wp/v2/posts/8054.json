It was invented long ago &#8211; in 2008 by the anonymous, mysterious developer or a group of developers who called themselves&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto\">Satoshi Nakamoto<\/a>. Even though the real name of the BTC creator is still unknown, it does not stop the &#8216;crypto father&#8217; from firmly making his way to the top.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By mentioning the &#8216;top&#8217;, we are considering not only the technological boom BTC brings with millions of miners and hundreds of Bitcoin-based products all around the globe but also its payment revolution and its astronomic success on the financial market. Just imagine, the lucky ones who came across BTC in the early 10&#8217;s now had multiplied their savings by 50,000%, 60,000%, or even more! They simply bought Bitcoin at the right time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price has changed a lot, and even though it is not that stable as the old-school traders wish it to be, BTC is still a great asset to add to your investment portfolio. With millions of active supporters, holders, and miners, the original crypto has all the power behind to show steady growth and development year-by-year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What does the BTC&#8217;s rate depend on? The answer is simple, yet a little complicated for newbies. One should clearly understand that Bitcoin is not a traditional asset as dollars or euro, and it faces quite different obstacles and rivals. BTC goes out of the traditional financial system, and its price can depend both on classical supply and demand as well as on market manipulations, technical hype, new services with crypto acceptance, or, on the contrary, fresh banking bans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cryptocurrencies are often linked with the volatility term, for a reason, of course, especially if you will closely look at their price charts over the years. As for Bitcoin, it has gone through a thorny path with dramatic falls to $1 level and unbelievable rises to $20,000, with a lack of supporters at one time and a global crypto boom slightly later. In this article, we are going to rewind the time for a little and dive into each year deeper to closely analyze the story of Bitcoin and mark the highlights for ourselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"bitcoin-price-in-2008\">Bitcoin price in 2008<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Bitcoin Price in 2008\"  class=\"wp-image-8082 pk-lazyload\"  width=\"244\"  height=\"244\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/giphy-3.gif\" ><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, August 18th, the domain name bitcoin.org was registered, and a few months later, on October 31st, Bitcoin was officially born. There were no crypto exchanges in 2008 nor price comparisons or purchases for BTC, so we could not actually talk about the price rates. Yet it would definitely change in the upcoming years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"2008-results-from-0-to-0\">2008 Results: from $0 to $0<br><br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"bitcoin-price-in-2009\">Bitcoin price in 2009<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This year was crucial for the history of Bitcoin, and not just because it was its first fully competitive year of existence. In January 2009, the BTC network was launched, and the first-ever bitcoin client was published to open-source by Satoshi Nakamoto. Early adopters, such as Nick Szabo, Hal Finney, and Wei Dai, downloaded it then and started to mine the digital gold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was hard to imagine then how far the &#8216;gold&#8217; would go, and how much money Bitcoin-2009 supporters would get. This year was also marked by the first transaction made with BTC: Satoshi Nakamoto sent Hal Finney 10 Bitcoins on January 12th, and it was an official start of billions of upcoming operations with BTC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What was the price of BTC then? There were still no crypto exchanges yet, so it was difficult to calculate Bitcoin&#8217;s price relative to anything. The only remarkable reference on this subject in 2009 was the BTC price published towards dollar exchange. It was only 1,309.83 BTC for $1. Also, on October 5th, 2009, the first Bitcoin trades had been launched on the New Liberty Standard stock exchange. Yet, it was not a cryptocurrency exchange, plus traders then hardly believed in the digital money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"2009-results-from-0-to-0-0007\">2009 Results: from $0 to $0.0007<br><br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"bitcoin-price-in-2010\">Bitcoin price in 2010<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Bitcoin price in 2010\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/OU3JyKMM7BRedt1x-j7la2V5hWAaYp0uX-NBmowf1ZeI4kZNph6lTgTAmfXWIzoXqeUyimBoHZMHtlnEj2zoacXx1MVbq_cjXb4HLWiraDRq6kZ54791h2oqFigIee5rXCPF7D-r\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything changed in 2010, on February 6th, when the Bitcoin Market become a historical first cryptocurrency exchange that, of course, traded BTC. Bitcoin had become much more popular, and regular non-tech people started to populate the fast-growing crypto community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as evidence of this, you can remember the world&#8217;s most popular story about expensive purchases for Bitcoins. Of course, we are talking about pizzas! On May 22nd, Laszlo Hanyecz indirectly bought two Papa John&#8217;s pizzas for 10,000 BTC. It was only 25 USD then, but for now&#8230; it could have been $80 mln!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The figures are shocking, yet the main point here is that all of that finally took place. Later on, in July, we could get to know famous Bitcoin volatility for the first time with a 10 times growth in just 24 hours. From 0.008 USD to 0.08 USD.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also this year, the MtGox cryptocurrency exchange was launched by Jed McCaleb, who would later become one of the key players of the global Ripple and Stellar projects. The first public miner was released, the first block was generated by a&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/mining-pools\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">mining pool<\/a>, and the Bitcoin share capital reached 1 million USD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"2010-results-from-0-0007-to-0-3\">2010 Results: from $0.0007 to $0.3<br><br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"bitcoin-price-in-2011\">Bitcoin price in 2011<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Bitcoin price in 2011\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/W6hlvGwCbsKedAs6LAwsTUQThE12f1RYfxZXI7nhmGW-S-w4yhlBOuEnvGENP14IcOLvgipo1G689s9bRURiqoW86W8AEPYO00-Sg0YnJUPszf7yc0P0WAc0sADQWQPte7n2TsyJ\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This year was marked as the whole cryptocurrency market dawn, given that other coins and cryptos started to emerge based on BTC open-source code. This, by the way, did not stop or replace Bitcoin on the throne. On the contrary, the whole market growth helped BTC to reach a new audience and attract even more people to the sphere.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The miners were working hard, and right at the beginning of 2011, 25% of the whole 21 million Bitcoin emission was already issued. Bitcoin community continued to grow, and there were no surprises that this trend brought new records and picks. January 27th, 2011, the most significant monetary transaction in Bitcoin&#8217;s history was registered with more than 100 trillion Zimbabwe dollars transferred in BTC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another remarkable milestone was the parity that Bitcoin achieved with dollar: February 9th, 2011, 1 BTC was worth 1 USD. That was the first time in the whole Bitcoin history, and that becomes a strong sign to the traditional financial world: something really worthy is coming. Bitcoin also started trading in different fiat pairs, i.e., BTC\/PLN, BTC\/EUR, BTC\/BRL, BTC\/GBP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin reached $10 level and then $31, with the total market cap risen to $10 million. First, crypto conferences took place, new apps and magazines were launched (including Bitcoin Magazine by Vitalik Buterin), the industry was confidently flourishing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"2011-results-from-0-3-to-4-72\">2011 Results: from $0.3 to $4.72<br><br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"bitcoin-price-in-2012\">Bitcoin price in 2012<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Bitcoin price in 2012\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/Q3aH033W6MXqB1myOugF8DsNVHfUz_O4Od4N9vU1w3xmZIJgIIZ775ARuo3mAYmB2NO4UV3hjR12UXuUfduSHyhgG4WT--Xul0iXXaQDwyqTu9J0ktutMomhH5AUeLCnp1bMIQ9Z\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This year was crucial in terms of spreading Bitcoin across the globe and implementing it into people&#8217;s lives. As BitPay reported, over 1,000 merchants were accepting BTC in 2012, and the list continued to enlarge. I.e., one of the world&#8217;s leading website platforms WordPress started accepting Bitcoins in November 2012.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later this month, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/bitcoin-halving-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">block reward<\/a>&nbsp;for miners was reduced for the first time in Bitcoin&#8217;s history.

April 1st, BTC reached the $100 level with more than a $1 bln market capitalization (for the first time ever though).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The alleged owner of one of the most famous darknet markets&#8217; Silk Road&#8217; Ross Ulbricht was arrested in 2013. FBI seized about 26,000 BTC. Also, this year, on October 29th, the first-ever&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/bitcoin-atm-guide\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bitcoin ATM<\/a>&nbsp;was introduced in Canada.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next month Bitcoin achieved another significant victory: its stock price for the first time went above $1,000 thanks to the public support of a game-creator company Zynga. Universities, websites, and different companies claimed that they were going to popularize and use BTC for their needs. But, not all organizations and countries shared the happiness: China banned cryptocurrencies on its territory in December, and this, unfortunately, lead to another immediate drop of BTC values.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"2013-results-from-13-51-to-751\">2013 Results: from $13.51 to $751<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Bitcoin Price 2013\"  class=\"wp-image-8095 pk-lazyload\"  width=\"305\"  height=\"350\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/giphy-2.gif\" ><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"bitcoin-price-in-2014\">Bitcoin price in 2014<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Bitcoin price in 2014\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/umgug55RKyYEcy_b-Nzd7yGcCl48DW-uKNzuoglgdmzkKl2yDHHQlguMTp0WDqnGlKMjEZ2zAN5tL3NBC9PXpGv19LQZsmg7hmz2f9j75sg5kuyO4XeJ9CPPkCn-csWkJYavZIPI\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Zynga used Bitcoins as an in-product currency for seven of its apps.
