It was developed as an outcome of a hard fork in blockchain technology. A hard fork means that a coin obeys new protocol rules. The new rules originated from the initial rules obeyed by Bitcoin. Also, the new protocols were incompatible with the original protocols.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main objective of creating BCH was to increase the block size. When the fork occurred, any person owning Bitcoins had a similar number of Bitcoin cash units. However, the main difference was that BCH supported larger blocks than Bitcoin. Also, BCH allowed more transactions per second than Bitcoin. When BCH was released, it was trading at $240 while Bitcoin was trading at $2700.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In November 2018, Bitcoin Cash underwent a fork. It split into Bitcoin Cash SV and Bitcoin Cash ABC. As more people invested in Bitcoin, it experienced scalability issues due to the 1-megabyte block size limitation. BCH solved the problem by increasing the block size to between 32 megabytes and 8 megabytes. While Bitcoin allowed up to 1500 transactions per block, BCH surged to 25000 transactions per block.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"bitcoin-cash-bch-price-analysis\">Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Analysis<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin cash had a price of 284 USD. When it was launched in August 2017, its price was 240 USD. Within a month, its price had risen to 550 USD and a market capitalization of 9 billion USD.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sharp increase of Bitcoin Cash prices was caused by the buying activity of traders and interest by miners. It was a coin that was convenient for mining, and it was believed to be Bitcoin&#8217;s competitor. Most people believed that they would make a lot of money from the coin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has a maximum supply of 21 million coins. Its market capitalization is 5,193,238, 871 billion USD.
