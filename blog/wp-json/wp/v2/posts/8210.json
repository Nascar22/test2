The correct way to do this is by using an Ethereum wallet. In this article, we reveal some of the top 10 Best Ethereum (ETH) wallets. Wallets are a secure piece of software that allows you to store your ETHs, make transactions and check your balance.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n[coin-section ticker=&#8221;ethereum&#8221; color-mode=&#8221;light&#8221;]\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"types-of-10-best-ethereum-eth-wallets\">Types of 10 Best Ethereum (ETH) wallets.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, blockchain specialists and enthusiasts have created several types of wallets, all for different convenience and security purposes. Today the most popular versions widely used among crypto owners are hardware, desktop &amp; mobile wallets. To figure out which of the existing ether wallets best suits your needs, let\u2019s take a closer look at those.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hardware wallet looks like a USB device. As it stores your private keys in an encrypted form, it is considered to be the safest option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Desktop wallet is an app that can be downloaded and installed on a computer or laptop. This option is not secure as it seems because if someone gets hold of your computer (even remotely), they could gain access to your wallet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobile wallet is downloaded on a smartphone. It is a great option that can be used at all times when you\u2019re on-the-go. Your crypto funds can be accessed from any location, as long as you have a cellular connection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Online wallet is a website that is a wallet that can be accessed from any device connected to the Internet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paper wallet represents a piece of paper with your private key on it. If ever is lost, it is impossible to recover.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-choose-the-among-the-top-10-best-ethereum-eth-wallets\">How to choose the among the top 10 Best Ethereum (ETH) wallets<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is common to choose Ether wallets based on their security level. When doing so, it is important to consider the following things:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Private keys storage and who has access. Private keys should only be available to you. It\u2019s not safe to entrust them to any platforms or other parties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Development team. You should always do your research to learn about the tech team behind the wallet to avoid scams.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data recovery. Many wallets can help you recover data in the worst-case scenario &#8211; if your money is lost. This is an important feature that increases the level of security of your funds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"custodial-vs-non-custodial-wallets\">Custodial vs non-custodial wallets<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your ethers are secure as long as only you can access your private keys. It\u2019s an important thing to keep in mind as such knowledge gives a person full access to funds stored in your wallet. With this being said, you should carefully review whether the wallet you chose is custodial or non-custodial.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A non-custodial wallet is a decentralized type of wallet where you own your private keys. During the setup, along with your private keys, you are required to write a mnemonic phrase to restore your funds in the future. Having private keys means that you are in complete control over the funds but here is the catch &#8211; if the mnemonic phrase is lost, you cannot restore access to your funds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A custodial wallet is more like a service or an exchange. The private keys are kept away from you and stored on servers. To access your funds, you simply use the password you created at the beginning. If lost, access to your account can be easily recovered as your private keys are known to the custodial wallet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the main difference lies in the ownership of core security \u2013 knowledge of the private key. This is a question of who you trust more. Can you rely on your good memory or would you rather entrust this to the service provider?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assuming you want to be in full control over the security of your funds, let\u2019s take a closer look at top custodial ether wallets for desktops, mobile and hardware. What are their strong and weak spots?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"best-desktop-top-10-best-ethereum-eth-wallets\">Best Desktop Top 10 Best Ethereum (ETH) wallets<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"atomic-wallet\">Atomic Wallet<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1686\"  height=\"977\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Atomic Ethereum wallet (ETH) 2020\"  class=\"wp-image-8211 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 1686px) 100vw, 1686px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/ethereum_wallet-2.png\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/ethereum_wallet-2.png 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/ethereum_wallet-2.png 884w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/ethereum_wallet-2.png 768w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/ethereum_wallet-2.png 1864w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/ethereum_wallet-2.png 1536w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/ethereum_wallet-2.png 2048w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/ethereum_wallet-2.png 380w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/ethereum_wallet-2.png 1686w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Atomic is a decentralized multi-currency wallet available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
