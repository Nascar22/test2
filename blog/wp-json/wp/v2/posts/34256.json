By allocating more CRO tokens during the Syndicate events, users also increase the share of their commitment, which in turn boosts the amount of the featured token they will receive after the Syndicate will have completed. It\u2019s important to note that CRO tokens allocated for the Syndicate\u200a\u2014\u200awhile awaiting for the final distribution\u200a\u2014\u200aare locked for a week, so opportunity costs consideration come into play. Furthermore, the gains made by entering the syndicates are dependent on the number of participants, as well as the total amount of CROs allocated, which are therefore subject to variations each time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"768\"  height=\"345\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Crypto.com\"  class=\"wp-image-34262 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/1_evRv3faRwNrdJaP1JTQZNA.png\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/1_evRv3faRwNrdJaP1JTQZNA.png 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/1_evRv3faRwNrdJaP1JTQZNA.png 1024w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/1_evRv3faRwNrdJaP1JTQZNA.png 768w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/1_evRv3faRwNrdJaP1JTQZNA.png 1920w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/1_evRv3faRwNrdJaP1JTQZNA.png 1536w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/1_evRv3faRwNrdJaP1JTQZNA.png 2048w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/1_evRv3faRwNrdJaP1JTQZNA.png 380w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Supercharger<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users that might be reluctant to stake tokens on the exchange \u2013 maybe due to the Syndicate\u2019s stricter requirements to join in \u2013 can still turn their CRO holdings to the \u201cSupercharger\u201d. Quoted by Crypto.com as a \u201cliquidity mining platform that allows users to deposit tokens in order to mine the most popular DeFi tokens\u201d, the Supercharger is available both on the Crypto.com Exchange and App and has no entry prerequisites.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How does it work? Just like with the Syndicate, a featured token is \u201csponsored\u201d by Crypto.com, this time for 30 days. During this period\u200a\u2014\u200aaka the \u201cCharging Period\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ausers can freely deposit\/withdraw any amount of CRO tokens, as liquidity, into the Supercharger. Hourly snapshots of the CROs provided by each user are taken\/captured and, at the end of the Charging Period, a proportional share of the user\u2019s contribution is awarded to him\/her. It\u2019s worth highlighting two features about this tool:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I. Users are free to leave their assets deposited for some time (e.g. 7 days), then withdraw them, then re-deposit them, and so on, anytime. The final distribution will consider each depositing period as well as the amount of CRO provided by each user and withdrawing before the 30 days will still make the user eligible to get a part of the Supercharger rewards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>II. Just like the Supercharger requires 30 days \u201cto charge\u201d, the same concept is applied to the user\u2019s rewards distribution: the interests earned will mature and be given out over the next 30 days after the charging period has ended (making the comprehensive charging period plus the post-charging a total of 60 days).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"crypto-com-s-payment-services\"><strong>Crypto.com\u2019s Payment Services<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Payment solutions provided by Crypto.com are declaredly meant to be the company\u2019s leading service (as also stated in the whitepaper) and have definitely been driving user acquisition and adoption to the platform.

And, in equal measure, that same amount that goes to the referred person will be awarded to the referral as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MCO Visa Card rewards &amp; benefits vary with the entity of the CRO staked on the app and cards are filled with perks ranging from cashbacks, full monthly reimbursement of Spotify, Netflix and Amazon subscriptions, rebates on Airbnb and Expedia purchases, free airport Lounge access, weekly awarded bonus interests calculated on the card-staked CROs and even a bombastic Private Jet Partnership for Obsidian Black MCO card owners\u200a\u2014\u200athe high-end, top of the line among MCO cards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  alt=\"\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Complete Set of MCO Visa Debit Cards<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we\u2019ve seen that the CRO token powers both the Payment and the Visa card ecosystems and while I\u2019ve already mentioned that CRO can be used as the source token to pay \u2013 using the Crypto.com Pay service \u2013 I must add that the cashback rewards are also paid in CRO instantly, after any eligible purchase.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"crypto-com-s-financial-services\"><strong>Crypto.com\u2019s Financial Services<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The company\u2019s financial products represent Crypto.com main source of revenue together with the exchange trading services and include:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Crypto Earn\u200a\u2014\u200aa service where users can deposit any among the 50+ tokens supported on the app and earn interest.

At the moment of this writing, the currently depositable assets include CRO, BTC, XRP, ETH, LTC, EOS and XLM.&nbsp;<\/li><li>DeFi Swap represents Crypto.com\u2019s take on Decentralized Swap Protocols. Via this application users can swap tokens (just like they would when using Uniswap or Balancer), provide liquidity to ERC-20 token pairs\u2019 liquidity pools and earn interests for doing so (in the form of a percentage when any swapping occurs on that pair). Swapping and providing liquidity on DeFi Swap is no different than doing the same operation on Uniswap. The only main difference here, compared to other similar DeFi protocols, is tied to the possibility (again) of staking CRO tokens: by supplying a greater amount of CROs and for a longer period of time (up to a 4 years timeframe) liquidity providers can get a boost on the yield earned for providing the pool assets. Furthermore, new partner pools are periodically sponsored and supplying liquidity to these advertised selected pools is incentivized by Crypto.com in the form of token airdrops.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  alt=\"\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Crypto Earn &amp; Crypto Credit<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"perspectives-and-takeaway\"><strong>Perspectives and Takeaway<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An overview of the CRO token and Crypto.com\u2019s value offering would not be complete without contextualizing the pros and cons of the features, services and products that the platform is offering, especially in light of the most recent news revolving around the CRO ecosystem as a whole.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the actual and sustained push of Bitcoin and Ethereum, in the past weeks, Crypto.com\u2019s token (CRO) price fell gradually at first, then quite abruptly (after the 2nd week of October), from $0.15 per token to more than half of that value, establishing itself at around the $0.06 mark. The dip was probably aided by the announcement of the MCO-CRO swap (initially made public in August and officially completed on September 2nd) and the sharp cut of Exchange and Earn interest rates on Crypto.com\u2019s exchange and app. More recently, the update to the current card staking rates occurred, establishing the actual increased amount of CRO tokens required to obtain higher tier cards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as these news hit the headlines, many early Crypto.com and MCO adopters were reportedly dissatisfied by the company\u2019s choices, which were addressed as the main factors leading to the substantial token \u201cdip\u201d. Nonetheless Crypto.com still managed to grow its user base achieving the impressive milestone of 5 million users, symbolizing that adoption is nevertheless much underway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to the above insight, the MCO Visa cards still represent the tip of the diamond in Crypto.com\u2019s value proposition and maintain huge palatability, despite the growing competition in the cryptocurrency cards market (especially from major players such as Swipe, Binance Card, as well as new ones that are now staging their moves like for example Plutus, Eidoo or QuiverX). It can\u2019t be underestimated the fact that the ample, diversified Card tiers haven\u2019t stopped attracting a wide user audience, ranging from users who prefer a more humble 1% cashback, no-staking required, freely shipped Midnight Blue card, to more affluent, demanding customers that will appreciate a richly overcharged (with perks and an astounding 8% cashback) Obsidian Black VIP card.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then Syndicate events, the Supercharger and DeFi Swap keep sustaining and adding more value to the CRO token, by providing users with a plethora of possibilities to earn and capitalize on their cryptocurrency investments. In all this, the CRO token plays the main role as the fundamental asset to even being able to access these tools and boosting payments, financial and trading related to the ecosystem, thus very pragmatically closing in towards true real world utility, aimed to both retail, institutional stakeholders and new future partners as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  alt=\"\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s coming next\u200a\u2014\u200aCrypto.com Roadmap<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally there\u2019s a lot more coming down the road, with the next announced step being CRO Main Net Launch, planned for Q4 2020\/Q1 2021, which will partially \u201cdetach\u201d CRO dependency as an ERC-20 token from Ethereum. This will potentially imply lower gas fees (at least compared to the current ones) and streamlined transactions. The focus will then switch towards the shipment of MCO Debit Cards at a global level, direct partnership with key international players, DeFi Lending\/Borrowing and DeFi Cards going live, as well as the aforementioned \u201cexchange upgrades\u201d with the coming of Derivatives and OTC. So many ambitious targets, which play along the team\u2019s vision.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"crypto-com-website\"><strong>Crypto.com Website<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For everything you need to know about CRO, visit the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/crypto.com\/\">official Crypto.com website.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"crypto-com-twitter\"><strong>Crypto.com Twitter<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep up with the latest updates from Crypto.com, follow them on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cryptocom\">Twitter<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"crypto-com-telegram\"><strong>Crypto.com Telegram<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Join the conversation on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/CryptoComOfficial\">Telegram<\/a>&nbsp;to stay on the know about Crypto.com and CRO.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-store-and-manage-cro\"><strong>How to store and manage CRO ?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The CRO token is compatible with numerous wallet providers, including Atomic Wallet, a secure and decentralized crypto wallet.
