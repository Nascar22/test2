Know all the details on Ripple&#8217;s future 2021 trend with a detailed analysis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ripple\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/what-is-cryptocurrency\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cryptocurrency<\/a>, which used to be one of the top three cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, recently saw its price plummet. This is due to a lawsuit filed against the blockchain company by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for allegedly selling unregistered securities under federal securities law. In response to the sudden lawsuit, major digital assets trading platforms announced a halt in trading of the XRP, and some even went further to delist the asset.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Population crypto assets custodian also had no option than to respond in a way to comply with regulations. Institutional-grade digital asset firm Grayscale Investment also took action to dissolve its XRP Trust, liquidate its XRP holdings, and distribute cash to the Trust&#8217;s shareholders. This, coupled with other happenings, is perceived to have contributed to Ripple&#8217;s decline in price in recent times. Despite all these, Ripple has been vibrant in its business and continues to render better services to its clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6 id=\"the-start\">The start<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you considering holding some XRP and want to know how much XRP will be valued in 2021 and beyond? Let&#8217;s look at the current state of Ripple as company and experts&#8217; opinions on XRP price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-ripple-xrp\"><strong>What is Ripple (XRP)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To better understand\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/ripple-wallet\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ripple<\/a>\u00a0and how it works. We will need to familiarize ourselves with some of the common terminologies you are likely to encounter. Let&#8217;s begin with XRP, the native digital currency that runs on the XRP ledger &#8211; an open-source, decentralized, and permissionless ledger. XRP as an asset is purposely designed for payments. Crypto holders can send XRP to anyone in the world without the need for a central entity to facilitate the process. Using XRP for financial transactions is cost-effective, scalable, and fast as compared to other alternatives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6 id=\"ripple-payments\">Ripple Payments<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<p>The RippleNet payment network is a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system created by Ripple Labs Inc. It enables institutions and organizations to start and run a high-performance business in the payment industry. With RippleNet, payments can be sent within three seconds and at a minuscule fee to any part of the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the quest of building a secure payment solution, Ryan Fugger created the OpenCoin payment system in 2014, which later transformed to Ripple. The project started severe business in 2012 when Jed McCaleb and Chris Larson came on board. As of the beginning of 2021, hundreds of financial institutions worldwide use RippleNet to offer a satisfactory payment service to their customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ripple&#8217;s current price is around $0.27 per coin. Hence, sitting at 5th place on the cryptocurrency ranking table with a market cap of about $12,386,155,167 behind Polkadot (DOT). DOT has an estimated market cap of $15,498,857,928. The top-ranked coins by market cap are in this order: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether USDT.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ripple-xrp-price-chart\"><strong>Ripple (XRP) Price Chart<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Ripple (XRP) Price Chart\"  class=\"wp-image-32465 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Ripple-XRP-Price-Chart0A.jpg\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"market-prediction-for-ripple-xrp-price-2021\"><strong>Market prediction for Ripple (XRP) price 2021<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We are all aware of how volatile the cryptocurrency market is.

Regardless, the project&#8217;s development is something we can&#8217;t deny. One of the most critical hurdles that might drawback the surge of Ripple&#8217;s current price is the current lawsuit by the SEC against the company. Once this is settled, we might see ripple coin prices appreciate over time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to reports weeks ago, Gary Gensler, the former chairman of the Commodity Future Trading Commission (CFTC), might be chosen by President-elect Joe Biden to take over the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and people in the crypto space are anticipating he doesn&#8217;t interfere in the ongoing investigations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an interview with\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/fortune.com\/2020\/10\/06\/ripple-leaving-us-america-crypto-regulation-sec-chris-larsen\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Fortune<\/a>\u00a0in October 2020, Chris Larsen. A senior executive at Ripple, commented on Ripple&#8217;s plan to relocate to a more crypto-friendly nation and named the UK and Singapore a possible destination for the company. He believes regulations in these countries are far more favorable than in the United States.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6 id=\"more\">More<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides all these obstacles, Ripple hasn&#8217;t deviated from its goal of creating a payment network to be used by financial institutions for cross-border payment at a competitive rate, speed, and maximum security. As of 2021, RippleNet is being utilized by over a hundred financial intuitions around the world. Some of its partners include JP Morgan, Banco Santander, and not forgetting big players like MoneyGram, and Standard Chartered. With the significant developments, Ripple&#8217;s current price is expected to change positively in the long term.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitrue digital asset exchange with its traditional investment service supports the staking of XRP for token holders. At the time of posting, users are getting an estimated annual percentage rate of 5.3%. This development might attract prospective investors and the entire XRP community, which will eventually affect ripple value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ripple-xrp-price-prediction-2025\"><strong>Ripple XRP price prediction 2025<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the long term, Ripple&#8217;s current price is expected to appreciate by most analysts. At the same time, they consider the project&#8217;s fundamentals, which is still reliable and technical analysis. As stated earlier, measures are being put in place to settle the issue with the SEC. Ripple is working tirelessly to onboard more partners and introduce innovative financial products to streamline the business processes in the payment and remittance sector.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some online prediction websites project the XRP value within the range of $0.50-$0.60 in the last quarter of 2025. In contrast to the bullish XRP price predictions, a popular asset prediction website also predicted XRP to close 2021 at $0.26 and steadily make an upwards move to the $0.10 &#8211; $0.12 range 2025.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CoinSwitch, on the other hand, predicted XRP price to reach $3 in 2023 and progress to touch $4.52 in 2025.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ripple-price-prediction-verdict\"><strong>Ripple price prediction verdict<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of the countless troubles being experienced, Ripple places itself as one of the promising crypto projects today. Ripple is expected to expand its operations to new geographical areas and introduce innovative products for financial institutions. Just last week and despite the ups and downs. Ripple landed a strategic partnership with Malaysian e-wallet company Mobile Money and BKash, which will bring 10 million users into their platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though the short-term XRP prediction might be bearish, the future seems to be full of growth opportunities. XRP might be a good investment in the long term for investors wanting to diversify their portfolios and looking for assets. Recent ripple news indicates bullish sentiment around the asset. It is highly recommended that you make financial decisions such as investing in XRP based on the information you&#8217;ve personally found through researching various sources, including expert opinion, technical and fundamental analysis, market trends, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are convinced and have decided to add XRP to your portfolio, you are free to&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/downloads\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">download Atomic Wallet<\/a>!
