The circulating supply is 232,720,097 BNTY, while the total supply is 500,000,000 BNTY. The daily trading volume is around $1,369.57 or 0.15811194 BTC. Bounty0x is trading on several major markets, yet the most active exchange that trades BNTY is Gate.io.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-time high of Bounty0x, $0.942771, was reached on Jan 08, 2018 &#8211; during the most famous cryptocurrency bull-run of Winter 2017-2018. On the other hand, the all-time low of BNTY, $0.000842, occurred not long ago on Oct 01, 2015. Currently, the estimated ROI (return on investment) of Bounty0x is -90.93%, which means that $100 worth of BNTY bought at the time of the Bounty0x launch would not yield any profit today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most recent price trend of Bounty0x appears to be readily positive. While in 24 hours, the price of BNTY rose by 383.77%, the 7-day price dynamics show a 391.02% increase in the price of BNTY. Despite that, the price predictions for Bounty0x are usually quite pessimistic. According to WalletInvestor, Bounty0x is a bad long-term investment. In one year from now, the price of BNTY may be as low as 0.0001061 USD, which would mean a drastic decrease compared to the current price. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that price manipulations of BNTY are possible due to the extremely low market capitalization, so one should be very careful when investing in Bounty0x.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-bounty0x-bnty\">What is Bounty0x (BNTY)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bounty0x is a decentralized bounty-hunting platform that enables anyone to manage bounty programs, and bounty hunters to receive payment for completing bounty tasks.
