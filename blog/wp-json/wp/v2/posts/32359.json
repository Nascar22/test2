Its birthplace is Portland, Oregon (a federal state that\u2019s more commonly associated with its colonial wild-west past and related gunslingers showdown movie scenes than cryptocurrency projects). 2013 was a year marked by the race towards the creation of new cryptocurrencies. The then project\u2019s founders, Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, started DogeCoin almost as a pun, combining two of the hottest topics at the time \u2014 the dog meme coupled with the cryptocurrency concept. Since the beginning, the project\u2019s mascot (and lucky charm) is the \u201cDoge, \u201ca seemingly eye-giggling Shiba Inu. It&#8217;s picture stands out as the coin\u2019s symbol and which is often used on web memes, as well as any application related to the coin, highlighting the funny &amp; user-friendly nature of this cryptocurrency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its playful\/joking inception, DogeCoin almost immediately managed to attract quite some attention. Both Markus and Palmer kept on conveying the sarcastic imprint about the coin, which would act as a sort of commentary to the unrealistic hype and the barrage of new cryptocurrencies coming out at the time. At the same time, the duo managed to partially steer from this funny dog-currency direction &amp; aim to a more accessible, utility-charged one that users would eventually utilize with much more ease to many other competing coins &#8211; as an online deposit cryptocurrency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DogeCoin\u2019s popularity has risen in time thanks to its stability and low price (due to the unlimited supply of the coin), which made it easy to use to do transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, the coin\u2019s history has not been without turmoil \u2014 during December 2013, millions of Doges were stolen by a hacker and then recovered thanks to community donations. Adding up to that, in 2015, Jackson Palmer left the community indefinitely, defining the community as \u201ctoxic,\u201d after a supposedly Doge user (Alex Green) was indicted for money laundering.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-32371 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image2.jpg\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Elon Musk has frequently made humorous tweets about DogeCoin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, despite these black swan events, and despite the last substantial update being released two years ago, DogeCoin\u2019s ascension has kept following a gradual upward spiral in terms of recognition, by becoming &#8211; by January 2014 &#8211; Reddit\u2019s official and regularly used coin, at each Reddit user\u2019s disposal. Its popularity was furthered by Elon Musk\u2019s frequent sound-off and tweeting about the meme coin, causing (even with<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1340590280848908288?s=20\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&nbsp;his latest sarcastic tweet about DOGE<\/a>) occasional spikes in the quotation, as well several renowned fundraising initiatives: Doge4Water, NASCAR, and even the notorious 2014 Jamaican bobsled team sponsorship for the Winter Olympics (for which the project even managed to raise an astounding sum of circa 129.000 dollars).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-32382 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image5.jpg\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Jamaican bobsled team and \u201cDoge.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today $DOGE is still and mainly used as a \u201cpure\u201d currency for payments thanks to its low unit price &#8211; which serves users as a mere efficient currency compared to other competing payment cryptos and trading\/capital gain purposes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dogecoin\u2019s Technology and Advantages<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we\u2019re all well aware, nowadays, the actual number of cryptocurrencies in circulation in the crypto universe is in the magnitude of thousands. It\u2019s often tough to identify projects that might be successful, especially when compared to more capitalized and established platforms, which usually bear with them structurally acknowledged technology and more substantial competitive advantages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dogecoin can be ascribed to such category of battle-tested projects, given its<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/academy\/cryptocurrency-algorithm\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&nbsp;underlying technological infrastructure<\/a>&nbsp;harking back to Bitcoin (Dogecoin implemented scrypt technology as well), but also bringing forth several important differences (e.g., by requiring dedicated FPGA and ASIC chips for mining), which mark a substantial improvement compared many of the Orange Coin\u2019s features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Pros<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, Dogecoin\u2019s transaction and validation protocol is relatively fast and often requires less than a minute to add a new block to the (Doge)chain, which is much quicker than Bitcoin or even Litecoin block-time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, unlike Bitcoin or<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/ama-litecoin-community\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&nbsp;Litecoin<\/a>, there is no maximum number of minable $DOGEs \u2014 as outlined earlier in the article, the supply is unlimited.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thirdly, Dogecoin is one of the most traded cryptocurrencies in terms of absolute values (circa 500k USD as the 24-hour trading volume at the time of writing). This statement refers not merely to the speculative trading (which represents more than 80% of the total $DOGE transactions) and all the transactions that involve \u201creal\u201d exchange between users for a service\/product in return for the corresponding sum of $DOGE. At the moment, there are more than 1000+ companies that accept Dogecoin as means of virtual payment, including many products\/services categories.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-32393 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image1-1.jpg\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dogecoin is backed by a solid, dedicated, worldwide community. Its members are known as \u201cShibes,\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What about the Cons?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Dogecoin has great potential, there is also some seemingly community-vocalized limit to the project (on which many would disagree, though): the underlying mining technology, analogous to<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/bitcoin-explained\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&nbsp;Bitcoin<\/a>, utilizes the proof-of-work algorithm, which is seen as expensive in terms of energy and computer equipment\/resources costs. There have been several proposals inside the Dogecoin community, asking for a change towards a block verification model that\u2019s more similar to Ethereum\u2019s, such as<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/proof-of-stake-vs-proof-of-work\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&nbsp;proof-of-stake<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-32404 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image4.jpg\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A true meme coin<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Perspective and Takeaways<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dogecoin \u2014 Notable Personalities &amp; Social Media<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dogecoin&nbsp;<\/strong>managed to capture the attention of many users online in the cryptocurrency world, especially (as stated previously) after several acknowledgments from Tesla\u2019s CEO Elon Musk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has inspired so many memes and, despite being \u201cinitiated as almost a prank coin,\u201d since then, it has managed to grow an incredible community, especially on Twitter and Reddit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elon Musk has actively spoken about Dogecoin, even though some of his tweets could have been considered contradictory. In April 2019, Musk tweeted that Dog\u2019s coin could be \u201chis\u201d favorite cryptocurrency, after stating that he found it pretty. In December 2020, he even changed his Twitter bio as \u201cEx Dogecoin\u2019s CEO,\u201d then<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/swapzoneio\/status\/1340617001220231169?s=20\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&nbsp;followed up by tweeting<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cOne word: DOGE.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This tweet alone seemed to have spurred a 20% value increase on Binance. Recently though, on January 9th, 2021, when questioned by a Twitter follower whether he had already investments in $DOGE, he replied with \u201cmaybe one day.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dogecoin and Tik Tok<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, \u201cflaunted\u201d the hostage<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=%23dogecointo1dollar&amp;src=typeahead_click\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&nbsp;#dogecoininto1dollar<\/a>, advancing a potentially bright future for $DOGE.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we know, dozens of online shops and sellers accept $DOGE as means of payment. Many users who want to be empowered with the chance of using cryptocurrencies to pay want to have the possibility to use $DOGE.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several crypto influencers and internet stars have been proposing to further Dogecoin\u2019s strategical influence via social media platforms, among which Tik Tok. Among these social media personalities and Instagram model<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CorinnaKopf\/status\/1347683809651671040?s=20\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&nbsp;Corinna Kopf who, on January 9th, 2021, tweeted<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cDogecoin needs to go viral on Tit Tok.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ms. Kopf constantly tweets about Dogecoin, having mentioned it many times in the past as well.

Many cryptocurrencies have been riding on the crest of the bull wave, with a surge in the magnitude of dozens, if not hundreds of percentage points of value (and in some cases even more) in the last months. While not directly &amp; \u201cproperly\u201d tied to the DeFi space, there is an indirect correlation between the DeFi growth and Doge\u2019s. As long as the trend is bullish, the time has proven that this will also reflect positively (in terms of value increase \u2014 and therefore market capitalization) on the most established coins, along which $DOGE is another co-protagonist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vantage Points<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>$DOGEs will continue to be minted indefinitely \u2014 even though with a lower minting rate \u2014 on Dogechain. The combination of all these factors might suggest that DOGE\u2019s rally might signal the beginning of a new cycle of the coin in the next future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that this cryptocurrency turned to the crypto markets with sarcasm does not imply that it\u2019s a non-credible project. Instead, it can boast an ecosystem that\u2019s within everyone\u2019s reach. DOGE\u2019s mascot \u2014 the cute Shiba Inu portrayed on the characteristic image of the coin \u2014 served and still serves to showcasing the ludic facet of the meme coin to make it more delicious. After all, it\u2019s not possible to consider $DOGE as a joke anymore, given its 1+ billion dollars of market cap. And that\u2019s also why there\u2019s not much to be amazed about if \u201cthe DOGE\u201d enjoys such fame and reputation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, as outlined earlier, it\u2019s quite apparent that Dogechain\u2019s execution speed, paired with a practical and intuitive ecosystem, made $DOGE\u2019s fortune in terms of popularity, with which this currency managed to distinguish itself over the multitude of other projects in the crypto space. Thus, its further success down the road will mostly depend on its adoption as money of exchange by way more merchants and stores than now, which will eventually drive more user adoption worldwide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dogecoin\u2019s Website<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For everything, you need to know about DOGE, visit the<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/dogecoin.com\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&nbsp;official Dogecoin website<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dogecoin\u2019s Twitter<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep up with the latest updates from Dogecoin, follow them on<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dogecoin\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&nbsp;Twitter<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dogecoin\u2019s Reddit<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join the conversation on<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dogecoin\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&nbsp;Reddit<\/a>&nbsp;to stay up-to-date about Dogecoin and DOGE.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dogecoin on BitcoinTalk &amp; LitecoinTalk Forums<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get in touch and socialize with other members of the Dogecoin community.

Support would involve not just an (excellent) community of fans (like Dogecoin\u2019s community) and dedicated miners. Still, probably a determined team laying continuous updates to keep innovating, a more structural and organized plan, and the will that allows the project to stay on the crest of the wave in an ever-expanding and paradigm-breaking sector called the crypto space.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Dogecoin&nbsp;is a cryptocurrency of great functional relevance, which gained popularity and adoption among crypto-users worldwide.
