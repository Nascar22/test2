At press time, the total market cap of the coin is equal to $1.2 BLN USD in TRX. The daily volume of TRX is about $1.1 BLN and it takes eleventh place in the top 20 cryptocurrencies in the world. The coin value is undeniable and the current TRX price is about $0,0189 USD for 1 TRX.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the last month, <a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/tron-price\">the coin price<\/a> has seen steady growth despite the total uncertainty on the whole market and surged over 18% from $0,0160 up to $0,0189 USD. At the beginning of 2019, the TRX coin price was about $0,0198 USD which means that the coin is moving back to its reference values, hence, the coin has strong community support and obvious potential to hit new highs in the upcoming future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The TRON coin can be stored and exchanged in Atomic Wallet, a secure decentralized cryptocurrency wallet for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and over the other 500 tokens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"tron-blockchain\">TRON Blockchain<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>TRON is an open-source <a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/what-is-blockchain\">decentralized blockchain network<\/a> that was presented back in 2017. It is the platform where anyone can store, publish and distribute entertainment content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>TRON aims to provide free access to virtual entertainment from all around the world. The task of the project is to let its users play online games, place bets, sell content, sit on social networks, watch online broadcasts and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, the creators of the project want to integrate the capabilities of the blockchain technology for the free and decentralized distribution of content. According to the ideology of Justin Sun, TRON Founder &amp; CEO, the project is designed to implement the concept of free Internet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To support the economic part of the TRON blockchain network, the TRX coin was created.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>TRON blockchain uses a consensus-building mechanism. This is a unique algorithm, which combines Delegated <a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/what-is-proof-of-stake\">Proof of Stake<\/a> (DPoS) and <a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/proof-of-stake-vs-proof-of-work\">Proof of Work<\/a> (POW) to confirm operations on the network. The project also has such a unique feature as direct transactions, which makes transfers between users almost free. With the help of TRON protocols, game developers can also build their own tokens <a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/what-are-dapps\">for content monetization in decentralized apps<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"tron-trx-price-prediction-2020\">TRON (TRX) Price Prediction 2020<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>TRON is in great demand among both retail and institutional investors. This can be evidenced by the great coin news, including a recent partnership between Samsung and TRON, the upcoming business lunch between TRON CEO and Warren Buffett and the return of TRON to second place in the Chinese cryptocurrency rating. All this and not only allows saying with confidence that the future of the coin is more than optimistic, which is no wonder that many of us would like to know TRX price prediction in the next 1-2 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To see how high TRX price can go, we\u2019ve gathered several the most ambitious TRON price predictions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Udi Wertheimer TRON Price Prediction<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to bitcoin developer Udi Wertheimer, TRX price prediction will be following: in the next year \u201cor so\u201d TRON <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/UDIWERTHEIMER\/status\/1194289879376703489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1194289879376703489&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinist.com%2Ftron-will-flip-ethereum-next-year-bitcoin-developer-calls%2F\">has all the potential<\/a> to defeat its main opponent \u2014 Ethereum (ETH), which means that TRON capitalization will likely double and the coin value will surge as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Changelly TRON Price Prediction<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The famous cryptocurrency exchange platform Changelly reports that according to Wall Street investors\u2019 price predictions, TRON price is likely to hit a minimum of $40 by the end of 2020. In case their prediction is correct, then every dollar put in TRON these days will pay off at least 1000 times in a year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Justin Sun TRON Price Prediction<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project founder himself is convinced that in the middle-term perspective, the Tether (USDT) stablecoin issued <a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/usdt-tron-airdrop\">on the TRON blockchain<\/a> will be the largest stablecoin in the world, which means that TRX valuation will follow the bull market as well.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weiss Ratings TRON Price Prediction<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cryptocurrency rating agency Weiss Ratings back at the beginning of 2019 declared the TRX\/USD pair to be \u201cthe most bullish looking\u201d chart of any top 10 cryptocurrency projects.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe popularity of this [TRON] project cannot be denied,\u201d wrote Weiss Ratings on Twitter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such a trust loan means a positive trend for cryptocurrency, regardless of the market situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crypto Rand<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A well-known investor and trader Crypto Rand awaits TRX to fly as the resistance level will become support in the next couple of months and the coin will \u201csqueeze against the local downtrend.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ivan on Tech<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe bulls are crazy right now in China. Look at TRON, look at Ontology, look at NEO, look at Qtum. All these coins are exploding,\u201d said famous cryptocurrency influencer Ivan on Tech. According to Ivan, the Chinese bags are pumping \u201clike never before\u201d these days even though TRON price is far from the crypto boom back in 2017. All this can only re-confirm that the coin is actively heating right now and it\u2019s just a matter of time when it\u2019s going to reach new high marks as it did before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BeInCrypto<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cryptocurrency media outlet BeInCrypto believes the cryptocurrency community is getting pretty close to \u201cthe next major move.\u201d The media outlet predicts TRON price to pump over 20% once the coin breaches another resistance level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"tron-price-prediction-verdict\">TRON Price Prediction Verdict<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, TRON is perhaps one of the fewest the most stable and best-looking investment options, since the project succeded to survive the crypto winter and continues to show confident signs of rapid development and adoption all over the world. The coin is able <a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/tron-wallet\">for hodling<\/a> and is exchangeable in Atomic Wallet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the fact that TRON founder recently confirmed the acquisition of large cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex, it\u2019s just a matter of time, when TRX is back to Top 3 by market capitalization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-buy-tron\">How to Buy TRON<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the partnership with the payment processor Simplex, TRX <a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/buy-tron\">can be instantly purchased<\/a> via Atomic Wallet with a credit card.
