There are too many ways how to make a BTC purchase. So, to avoid further confusion and any chance of losing money trying to grapple one\u2019s way into buying these coins, it is suitable to follow a guide on buying Bitcoins. It is not difficult as it only entails a few measurements. Initially, you must select a Bitcoin wallet. Now they come in different manners, hardware, desktop, mobile, web wallets as well as paper wallets. Whatever you choose is fine as long as you read and understand the regulations and terms under which they function.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"australia-s-regulations-on-bitcoin\">Australia\u2019s Regulations on Bitcoin<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While many nations have questioned and tried to fight cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins, Australia has done the complete opposite. Bitcoin is legal in Australia and more so, acknowledged and appreciated as property protected and scrutinized by the Capital Gains Tax (GGT). Before, cryptocurrency in Australia was double-taxed courtesy of the first policy instituted by the government immediately Bitcoin came to existence (Comply Advantage, 2019). However, the policy was changed as the regulatory board came to the understanding that it was unjustly hurting the cryptocurrency market. So feel free to use Bitcoins in Australia because you will not be breaking any laws. However, ensure to remain within the confines of the law.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analysts believe that Australia will continue remaking its regulations concerning Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as time goes by. One predicted regulatory change is the introduction of compliance with the AUSTRAC by all operating cryptocurrency exchange (Comply Advantage, 2019). The move is intended to prevent criminal activities because it requires verification of identity, keeping trade records and compliance with all obligatory reports to the government. Secondly, it is observed that Australia will also scrutinize ICOs as per the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), all in a bid to tame fraudulent transactions via crypto platforms (Comply Advantage, 2019).&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"buy-bitcoin-in-atomic-wallet-nbsp\">Buy Bitcoin in Atomic Wallet&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Atomic Wallet remains a trusted and reliable platform to buy Bitcoins, Ethereum, Stellar, Ripple, Litecoin, Dash and other top cryptos.
