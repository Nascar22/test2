The circulating supply is 41,817,047,634 DASH, while the maximum supply is 18,900,000 DASH. The daily trading volume is around $237,354,251 or 32,343 BTC. The most active exchange that trades DASH is ZBG.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-time high of DASH, $1,642.22, was reached on December 20, 2017 &#8211; during the most famous cryptocurrency bull-run of Winter 2017-2018. On the other hand, the all-time low of DASH, $0.213899, occurred way back on February 14, 2014. Currently, the estimated ROI (return on investment) of DASH is &gt; 9000%, which means that $100 worth of DASH bought at the time of the DASH launch would yield around $9000 of profit today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the coin first appeared on the cryptocurrency market in 2014, the price was as low as $0.27. Soon after launch, the price grew to $2-3, and for almost three years, no serious changes were observed in the price chart. Ever since March 2017, the price had been growing steadily due to a higher adoption rate and big investments. The growth peaked in December 2017 with a historical high of $1,642, after which the price dropped a little. However, later in January, another big spike occurred, with DASH reaching $1285,5. Since then, the coin has been following a general descending trend.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the course of the previous year, the price of Dash experienced a significant decrease. However, this pattern is almost universal in the cryptocurrency market. Most of the altcoins are mirroring the Bitcoin price graph, but not many of them look like they can recover the historic highs of the past. Since then, the price of Dash went through several price spikes, for instance, in the middle of 2019, when the price of a single coin went up to $170. By the end of the year, the price of DASH went back to the values of January 2019 and even lower, where it stays there for the time being. Still, Dash has definitely found its niche and is already very popular in charity programs for countries like Venezuela.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With its innovative masternode technology, DASH is undoubtedly an exciting player in the cryptocurrency world. DASH seeks to replace traditional payment methods with the unique InstantSend feature capable of competing with banking giants such as VISA. The speed and accessibility of DASH is a huge advantage and a good predictor for its future rate of adoption and price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The price of Dash has not experienced any significant changes from December 2018. Considering the rate of development and mass adoption, it is time for the price to soar soon, which is why several forecast services consider investing in Dash at this point potentially profitable.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to TradingBeasts, the price of a single DASH coin might reach a maximum of $123.80 in 2020, while the long-term predictions are even more promising. <a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/dash-price-prediction\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-dash\">What is DASH<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dash (DASH) is a decentralized digital currency that enables fast, secure, and private transactions around the world. Launched in 2014 by Evan Duffield, the project was primarily based on Bitcoin. During the first years of development, the focus of Dash began tending towards fungibility and speed to provide an alternative to cash both in online and offline payments (such as shops and restaurants).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The technology provided by DASH is particularly useful in regions with no universal access to the conventional banking system, or in countries with hyperinflation, where the use of the national currency has become impractical. The X11 hashing algorithm used by DASH combines 11 cryptographic functions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A distinct feature of Dash is the use of the masternode network. The InstantSend technology used by Dash prevents double-spending while completing a transaction in only 1 second. Thus, DASH could potentially withstand a 51% attack. Optional transaction anonymity, provided by the PrivateSend feature of Dash, is achieved by obscuring the origin of funds in a transaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"dash-wallet\">DASH Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your crypto wisely!
