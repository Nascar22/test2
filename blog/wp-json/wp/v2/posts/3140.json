The circulating supply is 1,128,357,877 LEND, while the total supply is 1,299,999,942 LEND. The daily trading volume is around $7,235,144 or 885.18515019 BTC. Aave is trading on fourteen active markets, yet the most active exchange that trades LEND is Binance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-time high of Aave, $0.442615, was reached on January 7, 2018 &#8211; during the most famous cryptocurrency bull-run of Winter 2017-2018. On the other hand, the all-time low of LEND, $0.003353, occurred fairly recently on September 6, 2019. Currently, the estimated ROI (return on investment) of Aave is 66.49%, which means that $100 worth of LEND bought at the time of the Aave launch would yield around $66 of profit today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, lending is one of the few crypto businesses that actually benefit from bear markets. The team notes that the famous bear market of 2018 was good for the platform since ETHLend saw a massive rise in the amount and volume of lending. The unique nature of Aave is thus a potential sign for the growth of LEND price. WalletInvestors predicts a 2-fold increase for LEND by the end of 2020, while a 5-year forecast reaches as high as $0.152.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-aave-lend\">What is Aave (LEND)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aave is a decentralized, open-source, non-custodial money market protocol, which allows users to participate as borrowers or depositors. Aave&#8217;s signature product is a decentralized lending platform called ETHLend. Depositors earn passive income while providing liquidity to the market; borrowers can borrow in both undercollateralized (one-block liquidity) and overcollateralized (perpetual) fashion.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The protocol is implemented in the form of smart contracts based on the Ethereum blockchain. The use of smart contracts ensures the security of the operations and eliminates the need for a middleman. LEND is the internal token of the system.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"aave-lend-wallet\">Aave (LEND) Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your crypto wisely!
