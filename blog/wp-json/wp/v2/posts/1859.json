EOS decentralized platform is widely used by developers to build their own dapps, and in order to access the EOS blockchain, it is necessary to have EOS coins. To date, the company has shown enormous potential of both products which attract investments as never before. One of the reasons behind the world\u2019s growing interest in EOS is the platform\u2019s ability to process 50,000 transactions per second.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the whole crypto market, last year&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/eos-wallet\">EOS&nbsp;<\/a>&nbsp;first faced rise and then a sharp decline in its value which represented a 71 % decrease in comparison to the coin\u2019s cost in January. Thus, the&nbsp;EOS coin price jumped from almost $9 in January to $21 in April&nbsp;which constituted the coin\u2019s highest value of 2018 and then fell to almost $2 over the course of the year.&nbsp;Despite all these fluctuations EOS ranks third in the classification of 100 largest cryptocurrencies&nbsp;in terms of market capitalization. According to the latest EOS news, the EOS current price is $3.69 USD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we accumulate various EOS price predictions made by famous crypto experts for the following two years and give a full explanation of where and how it is possible to buy and exchange EOS. In particular, you can use&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/\">Atomic Wallet<\/a>&nbsp;which supports over 300 different tokens and offers best currency exchange rates for many popular currency pairs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"the-history-of-eos\">The history of EOS<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The coin was created in 2017 by&nbsp;Daniel Larimer&nbsp;who had previously developed Bitshares and Steem. In contrast to the majority of cryptocurrencies, its ICO and token distribution lasted a year. EOS differs from other blockchain-based platforms in many ways: firstly, it processes over 50,000 operations per second; secondly, EOS cannot be mined but purchased and its maximum supply is one billion coins.<br><br>The biggest competitor &#8211; Bitcoin &#8211; has a much lower processing speed and cannot support the proper development of decentralized applications shooting up like mushrooms. Besides, EOS overcomes Ethereum in terms of processing speed and offers customers tools to build more top-notch applications. On these grounds, EOS is likely to have a bright future and stay one of the leaders among other coins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see in the chart below, the currency suffered some fluctuations during the last year and has been quite steady lately, the EOS current price is $3.69 USD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"market\"><span id=\"market-prediction-for-eos-price\">Market prediction for EOS price<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What are EOS price predictions for 2019? The future development of the coin is determined by various factors including upcoming upgrades of the platform as well as highly unpredictable market sentiment towards the coin which largely determines the EOS current price. Anyway, one cannot deny that EOS is a promising project that is able to measure up to the world\u2019s blockchain leaders such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/ethereum-wallet\">Ethereum<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/neo-wallet\">NEO<\/a>&nbsp;etc. According to the company founder Daniel Larimer, EOS presents brand new scalability and governance which make many dapps move to the platform. Some experts are optimistic about the coin\u2019s price in 2019 while others maintain a position that the year will be rather bearish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-eos-price-prediction\">#1 EOS Price Prediction<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the Steemit.com writers makes a positive EOS price prediction for 2019, indicating that the&nbsp;EOS coin price might reach $70&nbsp;over the course of the year in case the situation is favorable.&nbsp;Otherwise, EOS will not pass the $20 mark. Whether&nbsp;the cost of the coin&nbsp;will moon&nbsp;is determined by two main factors&nbsp;which are&nbsp;possible changes in the regulation of the crypto market, a potential&nbsp;massive capital inflow from China and the United States&nbsp;as well as upcoming upgrades of the platform which might attract a bigger audience and boost the price naturally. The author indicates that we just have to follow the EOS news, as any of these factors can provoke a fast growth of the coin\u2019s value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-walletinvestor-eos-price-prediction\">#2 WalletInvestor EOS Price Prediction<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another bullish EOS price prediction for 2019 is made by Wallet Investor. The experts see the coin as a favorable venture, forecasting a&nbsp;stable increase in the EOS value in the short term and expecting it to reach $911 USD in 2024.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-14301 pk-lazyload\"  width=\"268\"  height=\"442\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/eos-walletinvestor-price-prediction.png\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/eos-walletinvestor-price-prediction.png 123w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/eos-walletinvestor-price-prediction.png 311w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/eos-walletinvestor-price-prediction.png 361w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/eos-walletinvestor-price-prediction.png 655w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/eos-walletinvestor-price-prediction.png 932w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/eos-walletinvestor-price-prediction.png 1243w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-tradingbeasts-com-eos-price-prediction\">#3 TradingBeasts.com EOS Price Prediction<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tradingbeasts.com predicts a rather bearish year for the coin. Thus, the&nbsp;coin is expected to reach its maximum of $9.12 USD&nbsp;only by the end of the year, while&nbsp;the lowest EOS coin price might be $5.56 USD. The experts forecast a gradual increase in the coin\u2019s value throughout the year which is not expected to drop again until the EOS current price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-14313 pk-lazyload\"  width=\"203\"  height=\"401\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/eos-tradingbeasts-price-prediction.png\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/eos-tradingbeasts-price-prediction.png 297w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/eos-tradingbeasts-price-prediction-152x300.png 152w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"4-coinswitch-io-eos-price-prediction\">#4 CoinSwitch.io EOS Price Prediction<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A more optimistic forecast for 2019 EOS value is made by Coinswitch.co, emphasizing a great potential of the platform technology for the future of decentralized applications. According to the EOS news, 2019 will see major improvements of the platform which can increase the acceptance ratio. Taking it into consideration,&nbsp;the price of the coin is expected to reach $15 USD&nbsp;which is almost&nbsp;4 times bigger than its current price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"882\"  height=\"171\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-14325 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/eos-coinswitch-price-prediction.png\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/eos-coinswitch-price-prediction.png 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/eos-coinswitch-price-prediction.png 1024w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/eos-coinswitch-price-prediction.png 768w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/eos-coinswitch-price-prediction.png 1920w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/eos-coinswitch-price-prediction.png 1536w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/eos-coinswitch-price-prediction.png 2048w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/eos-coinswitch-price-prediction.png 380w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/eos-coinswitch-price-prediction.png 882w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"5-cryptoground-com-eos-price-prediction\">#5 CryptoGround.com EOS Price Prediction<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cryptoground.com makes a rather positive price estimate based on the neural network algorithm.

Right now EOS ranks fifth in the list of top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap and its trade volume continues to increase, as you can see in the EOS news. Looking ahead,&nbsp;EOS is expected to drop its value in March and significantly recover in May, maintaining a stable growth pace till the end of the year when it&nbsp;might reach the $15 mark. If the crypto regulation becomes more favorable, the&nbsp;coin\u2019s price is expected to hit $70 USD in December 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2020\"><span id=\"eos-price-prediction-2020\">EOS price prediction 2020<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>2020 EOS price estimate is more positive than the one for 2019. Thus,&nbsp;Coinswitch.co predicts an increase in its value during the first half of the year and in July 2020 EOS might hit the mark of $95. However, there is a slight chance that the price will decline for the rest of the year reaching $56 in December 2020. The forecast made by&nbsp;Tradingbeasts.com&nbsp;is less bullish, as the platform experts&nbsp;expect the price fluctuate from $10 to $16 throughout the year. Another prediction is given by&nbsp;Theoofy.com&nbsp;and&nbsp;includes two scenarios for 2020 EOS price behavior. Suggesting a climate is favorable, the&nbsp;coin might reach $22 throughout the year 2020, while in a less optimistic scenario EOS will stick to the $7 to 9$ mark. One way or another, EOS is seen as a significant competitor for Ethereum and is expected to upgrade its technology by far in the next two years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"verdict\"><span id=\"eos-price-prediction-verdict\">EOS Price Prediction Verdict<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018 EOS proved to be a perfect platform for the development of decentralized applications due to its advanced technologies which have already started to question Bitcoin\u2019s and Ethereum\u2019s leadership, as it says on the EOS news. With the growing popularity of the platform, the coin\u2019s value inevitably surges. It seems that EOS is destined to attract much more investors and grow in the next years. s<br><br>The EOS price predictions for 2019 may differ but almost all of them imply an increase in the coin\u2019s value for the upcoming months. Ranking fifth in terms of market capitalization, EOS takes the notions of scalability and governance to a whole new level, thus presenting a perfect option of investors, especially, for the long-term. If you are inclined to invest in EOS, you can benefit from a first non-custodial Atomic Wallet offering a chance to buy and manage more than three hundred coins in a single and easy-to-use interface.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"What is EOS?
