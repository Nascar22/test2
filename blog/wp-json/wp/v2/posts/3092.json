Its main purpose is to be a currency for tipping and money transferring withing popular social platforms. As a fulfillment, Reddcoin\u2019s open API supports all major networks: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Twitch and many more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main position of the coin is a payment service for digital life \u2014 like its main competitor Steem or legacy currencies like Snapchat\u2019s Snapcash. But this project is based on principles of blockchain which means it can be mined. Developers provide a native tool \u2014 the ReddID wallet. RDD\u2019s mining is based on the so-called Proof-of-Stake-and-Velocity algorithm abbreviated into PoSV. It is an advanced variation of the well-known PoS scheme, but it also takes into count the overall community activity of the miner. It means that the main influence factors are the amount of the staked coin and the participation rate. This mining model doesn\u2019t require any computing power, only being involved in the project. Therefore, RDD can be mined by simple computers, laptops or even tablets and smartphones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, the market positioning of the project seems to be quite actual. Social media is a huge market that never stops growing. Tipping the content creators and influencers is as common as leaving tips for good service in a restaurant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reddcoin went live on the ICO that took place at the end of 2013 and January 2014. It gathered $100 000 in BTC and ended on the 20th of January. At that point, 5.45 million RDD was distributed among the pre-sale participants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the technical part, Reddcoin initially forked from the Litecoin. Initially, it used the same classic PoW mining algorithm, but later it deployed a major update that changed the blockchain to the PoSV algorithm. Reddcoin is presented as a desktop soft solution and browser plugin that automatically integrates the RDD transaction feature on the supported websites. All the devices with installed Reddcoin\u2019s software act like nodes automatically and can earn benefits for its owner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"reddcoin-wallet\">Reddcoin Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your crypto wisely!
