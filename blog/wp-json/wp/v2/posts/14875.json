Augur runs on a protocol which is owned and operated by holders of the Ethereum-based Reputation token. In the prediction markets, users are able to bet on the outcomes of events such as election results, company performance, or even natural phenomena. This is done through purchasing shares that would either support or refute the proposed outcomes of such events. By design, the user-created markets can return fees to market participants while automating payouts using software that is meant to be fair, open-source, and completely decentralized.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"augur-wallet\">Augur Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your crypto wisely!
