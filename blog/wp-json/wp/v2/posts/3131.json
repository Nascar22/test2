At the moment of writing, the PAC price equals $0.00023, and this has been an approximate value in 2019. Paccoin has become one of the inexpensive cryptocurrencies in relation to its large supply of coins over 5.6 billion with a market capitalization of $4.54 million.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although, Paccoin has a faithful community that believes that the best is yet to come. According to PAC\u2019s fans, one day, the coin will become the \u201cInternet Penny,\u201d which could be applied to microtransactions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paccoin works on the Proof-of-Work mechanism, which means that their mining is generating new blocks. Over $14,000 PAC is being daily traded on 19 legit markets with 416 ranks, but it has been fluctuating for a few weeks by now. PAC does not take attention as a perspective option to invest shortly, but it has potentials indeed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organization and governance are two major most significant factors that can challenge the decentralized projects. If Bitcoin is still struggling with complex and micro-challenges, placing itself as both a digital currency and digital cash, Paccoin\u2019s low-value coin has overcome this issue. The great potential of PAC is to be fulfilled with the growth of the internet-based monetary transactions. The smaller e-commerce and online-games payments, the more beneficial it is for PAC because small payments are always safer. This can be considered as the vision on coin\u2019s usage by the project\u2019s team. In this sense, the investments in PAC may be quite useful if found in the long run. As some promise, we remind you that e-commerce companies and e-gaming are starting to accept crypto as their payment method.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only and the significant challenge that PAC can face in the future is the range of rivals around. There are many other projects with the price bracket of sub $1, like BitTorrent (BTT) and Tron (TRX). They were launched later than Paccoin; however, they are \u2018fighting\u2019 to be a decent and better bet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-paccoin-pac\">What is Paccoin (PAC)?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Paccoin (PAC) is also known to be the People&#8217;s Alternative Choice Coin. This coin has not gained much recognition even though it was introduced in 2015 and called by the name of a famous boxer Manny Pacquiao.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PAC presents itself as a virtual payment network to bridge sellers and buyers with a swift, secure, and affordable manners to send funds worldwide. Also, it&#8217;s known that the coin is one of the most consumer-friendly and philanthropic virtual currency up-to-date. Coins design is built in a way to allocate 5% of its mined coins to the community. It works as a sort of election in which the PAC users can vote on charitable causes worldwide. This tactful governing system allows people to help in humanitarian missions around the globe. Currently, the project and its community are focusing on the issues of the Venezuelan national currency hyperinflation and restoration of Cucuta in Colombia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paccoin is a solution to the main problems that Bitcoin has, i.e., transaction time and confidentiality. Since the launching, PAC has been regularly improved and rebranded. By now, it&#8217;s become a coin more anonymous than BTC. It&#8217;s a stable and safe one, and it gathers many crypto enthusiasts and developers around, who have many plans on PAC and tasks to complete.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most known recent campaigns from the Paccoin&#8217;s latest rebranding is a wide range of technology updates and proposals to make the project more accessible in entirely all market conditions. Plugin PAC woocommerce was introduced to enable the coin&#8217;s synchronization with any internet store that works on the WordPress platform. At the moment, the Paccoin&#8217;s team is working to develop other payment modes, too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"paccoin-wallet\">Paccoin Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your crypto wisely!
