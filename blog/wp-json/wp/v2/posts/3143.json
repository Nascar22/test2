The most active exchange that trades MNX is EXMO.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-time high of MinexCoin, $70.31, was reached on December 3, 2017 &#8211; during the most famous cryptocurrency bull-run of Winter 2017-2018. On the other hand, the all-time low of MNX, $0.028670, occurred fairly recently on July 17, 2019. Currently, the estimated ROI (return on investment) of MinexCoin is -97.17%, which means that $100 worth of MNX bought at the time of the MinexCoin launch would not yield any profit today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-minexcoin\">What is MinexCoin<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>MinexCoin (MNX) is a global blockchain-based payment system founded by a group of four Blockchain developers from Ukraine in 2016. The payment system is based on a low-volatility cryptocurrency, MNX, and operates within the Minex ecosystem. A unique characteristic of MinexCoin is a stable exchange rate, which renders MNX a reliable means of payment. The team also claims that the controllable growth of the MinexCoin price makes it a valuable tool for value storage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The control over volatility and price growth is achieved by the system&#8217;s dedicated algorithm, which acts similarly to a central bank &#8211; hence the name, MinexBank. The financial instruments employed in the Minex ecosystem allow traders to earn from the exchange rate margin without damaging the ecosystem itself.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Minex Platform combines features of an online cryptocurrency exchange, an investment platform, and a safe and straightforward processing platform for cryptocurrency operations and online shopping. Another remarkable feature of MNX blockchain is the support of Atomic Swaps, which enable fast and reliable cross-chain transactions without a third party involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"minexcoin-mnx-wallet\">MinexCoin (MNX) Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your crypto wisely!
