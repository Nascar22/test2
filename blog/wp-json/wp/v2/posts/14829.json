The circulating supply is 2,747,270,000 BTS, while the maximum supply is 3,600,570,502 BTS. The daily trading volume is around $3,100,580 or 358.66874676 BTC. Bitshares is trading on several major markets, yet the most active exchange that trades BTS is Binance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-time high of Bitshares, $0.916782, was reached on Jan 02, 2018 &#8211; during the most famous cryptocurrency bull-run of Winter 2017-2018. On the other hand, the all-time low of BTS, $0.002387, occurred way back on Jan 07, 2016. Currently, the estimated ROI (return on investment) of Bitshares is 40.29%, which means that $100 worth of BTS bought at the time of the Bitshares launch would yield about $40 of profit today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most recent price trend of Bitshares appears to be somewhat positive. Even though in 24 hours, the price of BTS fell by -9.62%, the 7-day price dynamics show a 13.30% increase in the price of BTS. Nevertheless, the price predictions for Bitshares are usually quite pessimistic. According to WalletInvestor, Bitshares is a bad long-term investment. In one year from now, the price of BTS may be as low as 0.000498 USD, which would mark a multi-fold decrease. Moreover, it is worth noting that price manipulations of BTS are possible due to the relatively low market capitalization, so one should be extremely careful when investing in Bitshares.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-bitshares-bts\">What is Bitshares (BTS)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitshares (BTS), formerly ProtoShares, is a peer-to-peer distributed ledger and network created by Dan Larimer, the co-founder of EOS, Steemit, and Cryptonomex.
