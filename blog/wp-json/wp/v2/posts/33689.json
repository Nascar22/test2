EOS is a token of the EOSIO network. This network provides a decentralized operating system. Likewise, the EOSIO use-case includes server hosting and cloud storage services, thereby allowing developers to build dApps and smart contracts more straightforwardly. In some manner, EOS is a competitor to the Ethereum blockchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It solves the gas fees problem, which is a significant setback for the Ethereum network. To use the EOSIO network, developers have to hold some of the tokens. Developers do not necessarily pay any fee; they only have to own or stake some EOS tokens. Similarly, EOS beats Ethereum in that it is capable of processing thousands of transactions every second. DApps created on EOSIO are accessible by all blockchain users. Thus, the EOSIO platform benefits everyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In June 2017, EOS began its initial coin offering, which would go on for one year. EOS raised over $4 billion by June 2018, when the blockchain went live. After the ICO, EOS value could boast of a market cap of about $13 billion. The brains behind this project are Dan Larimer and Brendan Blumer. Meanwhile, Dan Larimer already owns two blockchain platforms (Bitshares and Steemit). Likewise, Brendan Blumer is the CEO of Block.one, the company in charge of EOS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"eos-price-chart\"><strong>EOS Price Chart<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-33690 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/EOS-Price-Chart0A.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"market-prediction-for-eos-price-2021\"><strong>Market Prediction for EOS price 2021<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the close of 2020, EOS&#8217;s Relative Strength Index was above 40. The EOS coin price found support at $2.3 and resistance at $3.8 since February 2020. However, in February 2021, there was a breakout from resistance, and there is minimal potential for a retest. EOS price currently stands at $4.80. EOS ranks 19 in the list of cryptocurrencies. It has a market capitalization of $4,542,575,800; this is a vast reduction from 2018&#8217;s $13 billion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>EOS has a total supply of 1,027,124,687, and its circulating supply is over 950 million EOS coins. However, there is currently no data for EOS maximum supply. During the ICO, the EOS coin price reached an all-time high of $22.8 on April 29, 2018. Likewise, the coin&#8217;s all-time-low was $0.48, which was also during the one-year-long ICO. EOS trades on over 100 exchanges, including Binance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"eos-predictions-for-2021\"><strong>EOS Predictions for 2021<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Various experts and cryptocurrency investors have different EOS predictions. Some foresee a very bullish move in EOS value this year. However, some experts have reasons to forecast a reduction in EOS coin price in 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"satis-group-eos-price-prediction-2021\"><strong>Satis Group EOS Price Prediction 2021<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Satis Group, an ICO advisory firm, gave a prediction for EOS back in 2018. Satis Group makes predictions based on top-down analysis of markets of crypto assets. According to them, EOS will have a 42% reduction in price from $6 in 2018 to $3.6 in 2021. Their 3-year EOS predictions came to pass as the coin had a $3.6 price in January 2021. However, this was for a short time as EOS now sells for almost $4.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-33701 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Satis-Group-EOS-Price-Prediction-20210A.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"marginbuu-eos-price-prediction-2021\"><strong>Marginbuu EOS Price Prediction 2021<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Marginbuu, a popular Trading View user, is quite bullish on EOS. He sees Dan Larimer as a bad PR for the coin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Either way, it can only be good news that Dan Larimer is gone. He is terrible at PR and is hated in the crypto community.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marginbuu called EOS the &#8220;slowest grower in crypto.&#8221; However, he still has some hope in the asset if they appoint a new CTO.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As soon as Brenda announces a new CTO, EOS price USD can shoot up to $10,&#8221; he added. Likewise, on January 6, 2021, Margunbuu said that EOS&#8217; bull season&#8217; will begin as soon as it passes $4. Could the bull season be now?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-33712 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Marginbuu-EOS-Price-Prediction-20210A.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"trading-beasts-eos-price-prediction-2021\"><strong>Trading Beasts EOS Price Prediction 2021<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Trading beasts gave a bearish prediction for EOS price. According to them, EOS value is going to reduce in 2021. Likewise, they do not foresee a spike in EOS coin price in 2022. By the end of March, Trading Beasts expect EOS to close at $4.65. Meanwhile, by December 2021, EOS might close at $4.81, suggesting a bearish EOS news in 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-33723 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Trading-Beasts-EOS-Price-Prediction-20210A.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"wallet-investor-eos-price-prediction-2021\"><strong>Wallet Investor EOS Price Prediction 2021<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallet Investor uses a historical index to predict the future price of cryptocurrencies. They see EOS as a high-risk investment for long-term holders. EOS&#8217;s current price is almost $5. However, Wallet Investor predicts a dump in its price down to $3.3, which is about a 30% decrease. Likewise, their EOS price prediction does not suggest a pump to $10 anytime soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-33734 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Wallet-Investor-EOS-Price-Prediction-20210A.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"brave-new-coin-eos-price-prediction-2021\"><strong>Brave New Coin EOS Price Prediction 2021<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In a YouTube video, Brave New Coin made their analysis of EOS&#8217;s 2021 moves. Brave New Coin explained that EOS price USD has been bearish over the years. Also, since its 2018 all-time-high, it has not made any other significant moves. It seems to be maintaining its yearly support and resistance levels. Therefore, EOS has to break the current consolidation to impress investors. The video host mentioned he could not trade EOS because nothing is exciting about the coin. Brave New Coin is a Crypto Asset Market Data firm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-33745 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Brave-New-Coin-EOS-Price-Prediction-20210A.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"eos-price-prediction-2021\"><strong>EOS Price Prediction 2021<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking a good look at EOS fundamental and technical analysis, the coin seems to be bearish. There have been regular retests of its support and resistance zones. Likewise, the cryptocurrency has not gone anywhere close to its all-time-high since its launch. For now, EOS charts suggest more bearish than a bullish move. However, EOS price USD might close higher than $10 if there is a successful breakout from its current resistance zones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, EOS is a token for the EOSIO network. The EOSIO blockchain facilitates faster transactions and has a high throughput. Thus, if more projects launch on the blockchain, this can boost usage of the token. An increase in token adoption means an increase in price (all things being equal). However, EOS might have a setback in network usage as a result of competitors. A lot of projects are still launching on the Ethereum network. Likewise, the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a significant competitor for EOSIO.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"eos-price-prediction-2025\"><strong>EOS Price Prediction 2025<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From now till 2025, the EOS news might go viral. Likewise, just like other cryptocurrencies, most long-term investments turn out fruitful. EOS should not be left out as well. EOSIO and its parent company, Block.one, have influential crypto investors backing the project. Also, news, economic events, and political regulations positively affect cryptocurrencies sometimes. Thus, EOS price USD should be more than double in such an extended range of time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike Novogratz, the founder of Galaxy Digital, a Crypto Investment firm, is one of the large holders of EOS. Currently, Galaxy Digital is in partnership with EOSIO. The company has an EOS fund called the Galaxy EOS VC Fund. The fund invests in projects building on the EOSIO blockchain. Novogratz said he would keep working with Block.one because he believes in the outperformance of their project.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, Ali Ayyash, CEO of Lumeous, is quite an enthusiast of the EOS network. He claims EOS might beat Ethereum soon. Institutional Investors like Galaxy Digital and Lumeous are what EOS might need to push its price. With brilliant investors in support of the project, EOS predictions for 2025 will be a bullish move.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"eos-price-prediction-verdict\"><strong>EOS Price Prediction Verdict<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The EOSIO protocol has some level of support. As a result, high adoption might push its price high. In the coming months of 2021, EOS news might gain recognition in the cryptocurrency space. Furthermore, in coming years, the EOS coin piece will not remain the way it is. Market forces will push the project forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>EOS&#8217;s current price suggests the coin is heading up. However, from experience, there might be another correction on its way to the top. Meanwhile, for EOS news to receive more attention, there has to be an exciting update about it. The team has to work harder to push the project to the world. Although EOS tries to create a democratic blockchain, traders like Marginbuu think EOS has a bad PR. The team might want to work on building a more efficient community for the EOSIO project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>EOS is suitable for long-term buy as it has a solution-driven use case. Investors should see this crypto asset as an exciting option. Meanwhile, Atomic Wallet allows you to manage EOS in a decentralized wallet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-buy-eos\"><strong>How to Buy EOS<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Atomic Wallet is a multi-function decentralized wallet where users can store crypto assets.

Of course, this feature will be available in the future. However, users can securely store their EOS tokens in Atomic Wallet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-exchange-eos\"><strong>How to Exchange EOS<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of its decentralized features, Atomic Wallet supports coin exchange.
