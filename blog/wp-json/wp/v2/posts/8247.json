The main idea behind the project was to develop a coin that would allow people to receive and send money faster with minimal challenges as possible.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to its application, its users are spread over 100 countries. The people who use the coin have different age groups, backgrounds, and interests. RDD is one of the main digital social currencies that were developed to address specific needs when people interact through social media.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reddcoin has a unique way of working. For instance, you may be browsing, and then you come across a tweet or Facebook post that grabs your attention. You click on it, watch the video, or read the post, and you are impressed and happy about what you came across.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than just sharing the post, you may decide to reward or tip the user who posted or tweeted it through Reddcoin. There is no transaction fee for tipping the user. The move incentivizes and motivates the author to come up with better posts. Over time, the entire social media and creators benefit from digital assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"history-and-main-features-of-reddcoin-rdd\">History and Main Features of Reddcoin (RDD)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The coin was released to the public in 2014.

PoSV is a unique algorithm that tries to improve PoS by focusing on both stake (ownership) and velocity (activity). PoSV reduced the environmental impacts of mining major cryptocurrencies; such as Bitcoin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The coin has a decentralized tipping platform developed according to blockchain technology. It allows users to perform transactions in RDD, send and receive RDD while motivating creators to create innovative posts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform has a Redd-ID that serves as a unique ID. The ID allows users to associate a username with various essential information, such as social network identities and public keys. It offers an easy and unique way of identifying users that is implemented at the blockchain level.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, while most coins have a maximum supply. RDD does not have a limited supply. According to its developers, its supply will be infinity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"reddcoin-rdd-price-chart\">Reddcoin (RDD) Price Chart<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Reddcoin (RDD) Price Chart\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/iK5Y_JxzM2iqSkY6dEQIcaCpEBdBFyDxjZJOauCQSX80TVHeX25sZuCC1F3jVOZZuRZtApBxAaM81UfpFqogdSCLHg4VtTSrT9TIPwKLULyaabQT3_Aw9UyYqVDpgYTXS6zyoZNYS0-Nc7_KwQ\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Figure 1 showing RDD&#8217;s price from December 2018 to December 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"reddcoin-rdd-price-analysis\">Reddcoin (RDD) Price Analysis<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Its price on December 18, 2019, was $0.000647.
