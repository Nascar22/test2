The circulating supply is 121,320,613 LSK, while the total supply is 137,441,996 LSK. The daily trading volume is around $1,277,711 or 161.60955584 BTC. The most active exchange that trades LSK is Binance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-time high of Lisk, $39.31, was reached on January 7, 2018 &#8211; during the most famous cryptocurrency bull-run of Winter 2017-2018. On the other hand, the all-time low of LSK, $0.095652, occurred way back on March 2, 2017. Currently, the estimated ROI (return on investment) of Lisk is 668.44%, which means that $100 worth of LSK bought at the time of the Lisk launch would yield around $668 of profit today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with all cryptocurrencies, the price of LSK is directly proportional to the popularity of the platform. So, although the trading volume is relatively weak at this point, there seems to be a growing demand for LSK among users, which allows predicting the increase in its value.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a longer perspective, Lisk (LSK) has all the chances to enter the Top-50 cryptocurrencies list. However, this would require considerable work from Lisk developers to improve the technology. A positive prediction for LSK in 2020 is the price increase up to $3. However, with the cryptocurrency market being mostly unpredictable, it is challenging to claim anything with confidence. Keep track of the Lisk coin dynamics and stay tuned to be able to make data-driven predictions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-lisk-lsk\">What is Lisk (LSK)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lisk is a blockchain application platform with a dedicated Blockchain network and token (LSK), which was launched by Max Kordek and Oliver Beddows back in 2016. The basis of Lisk philosophy is to offer developers a flexible and straightforward Software Development Kit (SDK) suitable for the creation of decentralized applications (DApps), without the need to learn a new programming language from scratch.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each application on Lisk uses its own sidechain separate from the main blockchain. Unlike Ethereum, its principal competitor, Lisk (LSK), utilizes the Proof-of-Stake hash algorithm, meaning it is forged rather than mined. The average block time is 10 seconds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>LSK is the coin within the Lisk blockchain and DApps. LSK is not utilized as a payable digital asset, but rather an internal currency for developers in the network. Lisk coin can be traded against Bitcoin or Ethereum on multiple exchanges such as Binance, Coinroom, Bittrex, and HitBTC. Coinroom, Exrates, and Bitbay support the exchange of fiat money for LSK.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lisk offers a platform for the creation of decentralized applications, much like Ethereum. However, there are several features that make Lisk different:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Lisk aims to be a modular cryptocurrency, meaning that every application on Lisk uses its own sidechain that diverged from the main blockchain. A given sidechain is secured by exactly 101 master nodes; those are chosen by the owner. This may help to boost scalability, which is a problem for many blockchains. Another advantage is that the main chain is not affected by high volume transactions on the sidechains, so no interruptions or slowdowns occur in the network.<\/li><li>On the backend, NodeJS\/JavaScript is used; on the frontend, CSS3\/HTML5\/JavaScript is used.<\/li><li>Liks runs on a DPoS (Delegated-Proof-of-Stake) consensus mechanism, which makes it different from the PoW-based Ethereum (although Ethereum is planning to move to PoS around 2020).<\/li><li>LSK is mined in a process called forging, which is an unusual mechanism for traditional cryptocurrencies. It differs from mining in a way that only a given number of exactly 101 individuals (the ones with the highest votes from other LSK holders) are able to mine and secure the network. New LSK is created in the same process. The average block time is 10 seconds.<\/li><li>Lisk&#8217;s dedicated virtual machine (VM) is currently in development.<\/li><li>Lisk is totally open-source; the development process can be tracked on GitHub.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"lisk-lsk-wallet\">Lisk (LSK) Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your crypto wisely!
