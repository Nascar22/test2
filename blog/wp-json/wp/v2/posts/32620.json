This article gives detailed information about XRP, its history, and how it has leveraged the 2008 market crash to become one of the best global payments systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"history-of-ripple\"><strong>History of Ripple<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Britannica<\/a>, the financial crisis of 2008, also known as the &#8216;subprime mortgage crisis,&#8217; where a severe contraction and unavailability of global liquidity, which originated in the United States due to the collapse of the US housing market, threatened to destroy the international and global financial system. This global liquidity contraction resulted in the near-failure and collapse of several significant investment and commercial banks, mortgage lenders, insurance companies, savings and loan associations and precipitated the Great Recession of 2008. XRP, the native digital asset of XRP Ledger and RippleNet, functions to satisfy the need for on-demand liquidity. RippleNet, a global payment network built on Ripple&#8217;s&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/c\/consensus-mechanism-cryptocurrency.asp\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">consensus<\/a>&nbsp;ledger (also known as XRP Ledger or XRPL), is the Financial Network of the Future, smoothly running a high-performance global payments business by streamlining global payments and expanding its client&#8217;s reach to new customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>RippleNet offers a service of connecting its clients to financial institutions worldwide via its unique&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/application-programming-interface-api\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">API<\/a>&nbsp;(Application Programming Interface) system, making transferring funds faster, cheaper, and more reliable for its customers. RippleNet is a global payment network built on XRP Ledger, while XRP Ledger is an open-source distributed ledger created by its parent company, Ripple. In 2004, Ryan Fugger founded a fintech company known as RipplePay in Vancouver, Canada, long before&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Satoshi Nakamoto<\/a>&nbsp;released his first version of the&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/bitcoin-explained\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bitcoin<\/a>&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/what-is-blockchain\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">blockchain<\/a>&nbsp;whitepaper. The RipplePay protocol&#8217;s vision was to serve as a peer-to-peer network connecting financial institutions and individuals to replace the banks and traditional institutions. Satoshi Nakamoto knew about RipplePay fintech and gave this remark in a&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/nakamotostudies.org\/emails\/satoshi-reply-to-mike-hearn\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bitcoin archive<\/a>,&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;Ripple is interesting in that it&#8217;s the only other system that does something with trust besides concentrating it into a central server.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-32632 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/image6.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&nbsp;RipplePay logo during the period of the company&#8217;s existence. (Source: Ripplepay.com)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to RipplePay&#8217;s basic theory of the traditional banking system, since banks update one&#8217;s loan balance to the bank during financial transactions, RipplePay held a firm belief that they could replace banks by creating a peer-to-peer trust network where individuals could directly loan each other financial assets and alterations to these loan balances enable payments\/ transactions. Payments and transactions would act as updates to these loan balances, provided that the peer-to-peer trust network can trace a path of relationships from the payer to the recipient. The RipplePay network architecture was not different from the Bitcoin Lightning Network design, except with counterparty risk, where the system was geared towards centralization around a few large banks. However, the vision and goals of the current Ripple system are very opposite to this original idea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, Bitcoin gained some traction and began to capture Ripple&#8217;s target demographic\/market&#8217;s attention while succeeding where RipplePay had failed, using a superior peer-to-peer payment network architecture. In May 2011, Jed McCaleb, an early Bitcoin pioneer, joined RipplePay with the hope of addressing some of the flaws of RipplePay. According to WizSec&#8217;s Kim Nilsson&#8217;s analysis of the failure of Mt. Gox, Ryan Fugger, founder of RipplePay, handed over the leadership of RipplePay to McCaleb, who founded Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange in 2010 and sold the exchange to Mark Karpeles in March 2011 due to insolvency issues. In 2012, Jen McCaleb hired Chris Larsen (Current Executive Chairman of Ripple&#8217;s board of directors and also co-founder of Ripple) to commence the&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenCoin era, the first of three name changes occurred between 2012 and 2015. Jesse Powell, founder and CEO of Kraken exchange in October 2012, took part in Ripple&#8217;s first seed round with an investment believed to be worth about $200,000.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In January 2013, OpenCoin launched its native token\/ cryptocurrency, XRP, of which 80% of the total 100billion supply was given to OpenCoin to build its financial technology as the Ripple wiki says:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>XRP cannot be debased. When the Ripple network was created, 100 billion XRP was issued. The founders gave 80 billion XRP to the Ripple Labs. Ripple Labs will develop the Ripple software, promote the Ripple payment system, give away XRP, and sell XRP.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In April 2013, Google Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, IDG Capital Partners, FF Angel, Lightspeed Venture Partners, the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, and Vast Ventures took part in a $1.5 million fundraiser for OpenCoin, which went ahead to make the source code of Ripple Network open and rename to Ripple Labs. Between June 2013 and May 2014, McCaleb left Ripple Labs and created Stellar&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/stellar-wallet\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lumens (XLM)<\/a>, a hard fork of XRP. After renaming to &#8216;Ripple&#8217; from &#8216;OpenCoin&#8217; in October 2015, Ripple has gone ahead to partner with over three hundred financial institutions globally with its seven-member board of directors and eight-core team members led by CEO Brad Garlinghouse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On December 22, 2020, the&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/press-release\/2020-338\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">American Securities and Exchange Commission<\/a>&nbsp;announced that it had filed legal action against Ripple Labs Inc., Two of its executives, who happen to be significant security(XRP coin) holders.

The Ripple Consensus Protocol Algorithm defines how the&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/xrpl.org\/xrp-ledger-overview.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">XRP Ledger<\/a>&nbsp;is managed by a network of independent Ripple validator nodes, of which 80% of these nodes validate and verify transactions on the network. Although anyone can become a validator, Ripple maintains and ensures a given set of validators that can be trusted. This list of trusted nodes is referred to as the Unique Node List (UNL). Ripple uses the XRP Ledger for real-time payments and settlement, acting as the home of XRP, its digital asset assigned to bridge the many different currencies in use worldwide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-32654 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/image1.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ripple Consensus protocol solves the double-spend problem: preventing a malicious person from successfully spending the same digital money twice. Achieving this without a central authority is difficult as it can result in a dispute about the sequence of transactions, especially when multiple transactions co-occur. Read more about how the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol solves this problem&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/xrpl.org\/consensus-principles-and-rules.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here<\/a>. Suppose Jason in Canada wants to send 1,000 Canadian Dollars to Gerd, his son, in Italy. In that case, Jason will send the funds to a Ripple partner&#8217;s financial institution, and this Canadian Dollar would be converted to XRP and the transaction validated on the XRP Ledger and Ripple Network. Once validated successfully, the funds can be withdrawn as Euro by Gerd in Italy. This remittance occurs within seconds. Ripple&#8217;s feature eliminates the need for financial institutions and remittance services to pre-fund accounts with On-Demand Liquidity during cross-border transactions and payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ripple also uses&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/interledger.org\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Interledger<\/a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/blockchain-interoperability\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Interoperable<\/a>&nbsp;Payments. Interledger is an open protocol built to send payments across different ledgers. Interledger easily enables interoperability for any value transfer system with its open and less complicated design and protocol. The Interledger provides a coherent global financial infrastructure, where anyone connected to the Interledger can transact with another individual via their choice&#8217;s underlying systems and currencies. The Interledger Protocol is neither a blockchain, a token, nor a central service, but rather it is the core of the Interledger protocol suite. Interledger is a standard way of bridging financial or fintech systems. When two entities or individuals engage in a business transaction online, the sender sends money while receiving money. The Interledger architecture or design allows connectors to forward money from the sender through the network until it reaches the receiver.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Interledger Architecture(source:interledger.org)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-32665 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/image3.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ripple also uses&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/paystring.org\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PayString<\/a>&nbsp;for its Universal Payment Address service. Paying is a unique protocol for human-readable addresses for all forms of payments and any currency of choice. PayString enables financial institutions to provide their users\/ clients with a single and simple, easy-to-use address that works for all their wallet&#8217;s payment networks. It can be referred to as an email for payments. With its open Source standards and protocols, users can use human-readable addresses to transmit value in their chosen currency through the PayString network. This network allows participants to reach one another through a standardized address. The PayString protocol can be used when transacting with any cryptocurrency or fiat currency. Any individual or user can deploy their PayString server quickly and efficiently on HTTP\/DNS standards, using a simple ID that works across any payment network and involving any currency.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>RippleNet makes it easier than ever to run a high-performance and efficient payments or financial settlement business with its advanced blockchain technology for global payments, making it easy for financial institutions to expand into new global markets and eliminate pre-funding by leveraging the power of XRP through RippleNet&#8217;s On-Demand Liquidity service. In the words of Daumantas Dvilinskas, Co-Founder and CEO at TransferGo,&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;RippleNet has given us a competitive edge in India, where we&#8217;re making a real difference to people&#8217;s lives by providing faster and cheaper remittances.

Being a faster, cheaper, and more scalable digital asset, Ripple uses XRP, RippleNet, and the XRP Ledger to power its innovative technology across the global payment and financial settlement space.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>XRP was created in January 2013 with a total supply of 100billion coins and a circulating supply of 45.5billion coins. XRP is currently valued at $12.5billion at a $0.28\/XRP coin price, making it the 5th most valuable cryptocurrency with a&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/cryptocurrency-market-cap\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">market capitalization<\/a>&nbsp;dominance of 1.29%.

In June 2019, there was a ripple of tears as hackers successfully breached over 100 Ripple XRP Ledger wallets managed by the service provider, GateHub, stealing over 23million XRP coins worth about $10 million at the time. All the funds were laundered through exchanges and mixer services, including Changelly, Kucoin, Huobi, Binance, and HitBTC. The hack was reported to local authorities, but the funds were never recovered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-does-the-xrp-ledger-work\"><strong>How Does the XRP Ledger work?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The XRP Ledger is an open, shared, distributed ledger. It operates as a peer-to-peer network of rippled servers that distributes transactions among themselves. The consensus process is a necessary process that determines which transactions get applied to each new version of the ledger. The ledger is maintained by independent members (over 36 validators including universities, exchanges, and even financial institutions) of a global &#8220;XRP Community,&#8221; of which Ripple is an active member, running six validator nodes. Each independent validator node agrees in the order and validity of every XRP transaction on the XRP Ledger. This agreement, referred to as a consensus that occurs every 3-5 seconds, serves as the final and irreversible settlement of the XRP Ledger&#8217;s transactions. XRP Ledger has its unique innovations:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u25cf xCurrent: xCurrent processes real-time payments and enables banks and other financial institutions to offer cross-border payments services with a low cost of a settlement. xCurrent is designed to operate with the risks, compliance, and information security frameworks of financial institutions. xCurrent is built to interface with the financial institution&#8217;s systems using an API interface.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u25cf&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>xRapid:<\/strong>&nbsp;Normally, payments into emerging markets often require pre-funded local currency accounts, resulting in the high cost of liquidity. xRapid allows financial institutions and remittance service providers to minimize its liquidity cost while improving their customer experience. xRapid uses XRP to lower the capital required for liquidity by offering on-demand liquidity, enabling real-time payments in emerging markets. This provides an efficient, scalable, and reliable liquidity option to cross-border service payments, settlements, and remittance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u25cf xVia: xVia is for corporations, payment providers, and banks that make global payments with a single integration. xVia uses an easy-to-use API that requires no software installation, enabling users to send payments globally with transparency and an option for customized payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Benefits of XRP in Payments<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u25cf Fast: XRP provides fast and swift payments moving across the XRP Ledger, usually settled within 4 seconds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u25cf Scalable: XRP consistently and efficiently handles about 1,500 transactions per second every day and can further scale to handle the same throughput as Visa, which handles about 65,000 transactions per second as of July 15, 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u25cf&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Distributed:<\/strong>&nbsp;XRP runs on a decentralized, distributed network of 36+ validators globally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u25cf Stable: XRP boasts a seven-year record of uninterrupted technology, making it ideal for institutional and global use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u25cf Eco-Friendly: XRP Ledger settles XRP transactions instantly without using the same energy required by proof of work (or mining as seen with Bitcoin)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"types-of-payments-using-xrp\"><strong>Types of Payments using XRP<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The XRP Ledger supports different forms of payment types.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u25cf&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Direct XRP Payments:<\/strong>&nbsp;Direct XRP payments are the simplest and easiest way to send value in the XRP Ledger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u25cf&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Cross-Currency Payments:<\/strong>&nbsp;Cross-currency payments involve sending funds in the desired currency with the recipient receiving funds in another currency of choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u25cf&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Checks:<\/strong>&nbsp;Checks allows customers to create deferred payments that can either be canceled or cashed out by the intended recipients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u25cf&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Escrow:<\/strong>&nbsp;Escrows set aside XRP and deliver it later, at an agreed time when given terms and conditions are met. Escrows can either depend on time limits or cryptographic conditions, or both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u25cf&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Partial Payments:<\/strong>&nbsp;This form of payment subtracts fees from the amount sent, delivering a flexible amount. Partial payments are useful for returning unwanted or unrequested payments without incurring additional fees during refund.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u25cf&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Payment Channels:<\/strong>&nbsp;Payment Channels enable fast, asynchronous XRP payments divided into tiny micro funds and settled later at the desired time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"storing-managing-and-exchanging-xrp-coins\"><strong>Storing, managing, and exchanging XRP coins<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently listed and actively traded on over thirty centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges, XRP is supported by multiple wallet providers, including Atomic Wallet.

This airdrop snapshot was supported by many exchanges and wallets, including Atomic wallet. Flare network will initially distribute 15% of the total Spark airdrop to eligible users (users who held XRP in their wallets during the snapshot). Over the next 25-34 months, the Flare network would airdrop the remaining supply of spark at the rate of 3% each month. If you are eligible for the airdrop and took part in the snapshot, anticipate your airdropped Spark coins within the first half of 2021 while watching as legal issues between the SEC and Ripple unravel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ripple Website<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visit&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/ripple.com\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ripple&#8217;s&nbsp;<\/a>Official Website for more information on Ripple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>XRP Community<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join the XRP&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.xrpchat.com\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">community<\/a>&nbsp;and get involved in the project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>XRP Block Explorer<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Track your XRP transactions via the&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/xrpscan.com\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">xrpscan<\/a>&nbsp;Block Explorer.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ripple Twitter<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Ripple\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@Ripple<\/a>&nbsp;on Twitter to keep up with the latest updates and news.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"As the most Corporate&nbsp;Cryptocurrency, XRP, the native digital asset on the XRP Ledger and RippleNet, is a digital&hellip;\n","protected":false},"author":9,"featured_media":34299,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[14,114],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.4.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>What is Ripple (XRP): A COMPLETE BEGINNER GUIDE<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"As the most Corporate Cryptocurrency, XRP, the native digital asset on the XRP Ledger and RippleNet, is a digital asset built for payments cross-border settlements.
