There are many projects that are being implemented that will build DGB. DGB will be the foundation for the future. The comments show that DGB can only get better in 2020, and its value will increase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"john-leonard-member-of-dgb-community-price-prediction-2020\">John Leonard, Member of DGB Community, Price Prediction 2020<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>John says that he started investing in DGB in 2014.

He believes that investors should invest in the coin without fear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"rudy-bouwman-ceo-digibyte-awareness-team-price-prediction-2020\">Rudy Bouwman, CEO DigiByte Awareness Team, Price Prediction 2020<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rudy mentions that the total market capitalization for the cryptocurrency in 2020 may vary between $1 trillion and $40 trillion.

He states that a price of $10 USD to $15 USD is quite realistic.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"john-mcafee-price-prediction-2020\">John McAfee, Price Prediction 2020<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>He believes that DGB is a valuable investment because it is about 40 times faster than some of the main cryptocurrencies. Also, it has one of the most decentralized mining systems globally. He believes that DGB could be a sleeping giant. It means that DGB\u2019s price could rise significantly in the future.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"factors-contributing-to-dgb-s-growth\">Factors Contributing to DGB\u2019s Growth<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the issues affecting DigiByte\u2019s growth is its focus on cybersecurity for digital payments. The coin is a digital asset that is mined through a complex combination of cryptographic algorithms. The process has the objective of maximizing difficult stability and minimizing mining centralization. Also, it allows the process to reach a consensus at a speed that is as fast as 15-second block timings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, the coin has five different mining algorithms that are used together to mine the co. The use of different mining algorithms sustains the speed of DigiByte. It also prevents mining centralization. The DGB research and development team is working to increase the speed of the network to over 250000 transactions per second.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, the digital asset is also pioneering new innovations and securing data. DGB is constantly looking for ways of adding improvements, upgrades, and features to stay ahead of the competition in the crypto market. They are also implementing a Digi-ID. A Digi-ID is a secure way of login into applications and websites using a QR code. The QR code will eliminate the need for a passcode and username.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If DigiByte achieves its objectives, it will acquire more users, and its price will increase significantly in 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"digibyte-price-prediction-verdict\">DigiByte Price Prediction Verdict<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Investing in DigiByte is a unique investment opportunity. Its upgrades and investment in new technologies are outstanding. It has several attractive features that investors can risk a stake with. The coin focuses on decentralized applications, digital assets, and currency payments. DigiByte has divided its core into three main functions that give it a robust look.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of the three main functions was designed to boost scalability functions. The designs ensure that the digital asset can accommodate an increased number of users and transaction speeds. As mentioned earlier, DigiByte could be a sleeping giant in the crypto market. Due to their focus on technology, the cryptocurrency could be on the verge of high-performance technology.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, DigiByte\u2019s price has highly been influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s prices. It is expected that Bitcoin\u2019s prices will surge in 2020 and carry along DGB with it. There has been increased interest in DGB, and there could be mass adoption of the coin in 2020. The prospective upgrades and new partnerships will increase the number of users. Ultimately, its value will increase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\">Atomic Wallet<\/a> allows you to take part in DigiByte\u2019s success.
