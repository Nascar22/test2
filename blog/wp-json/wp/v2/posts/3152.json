The circulating supply is 15,831,459 AEON, while there is no information on the total supply of AEON. The daily trading volume is around $2,773.01 or 0.34039253 BTC. Aeon is trading on several major markets, yet the most active exchange that trades AEON is TradeOgre.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-time high of Aeon, $9.45, was reached on January 9, 2018 &#8211; during the most famous cryptocurrency bull-run of Winter 2017-2018. On the other hand, the all-time low of AEON, $0.001905, occurred way back on September 30, 2015. Currently, the estimated ROI (return on investment) of Aeon is 1,462.80%, which means that $100 worth of AEON bought at the time of the Aeon launch would yield around $1,462 of profit today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In June 2014, when Aeon first appeared on the cryptocurrency market, the price was fluctuating around values way below 1 cent. Despite the fluctuations, the price chart of AEON was relatively flat in the first two years of its existence, and it wasn&#8217;t until August 2016 that the first serious price move hit the coin. That was when AEON reached a local high of $0.195, which marked a multi-fold increase in price as compared to the initial value. The following year of 2017 was a turbulent one for the whole cryptocurrency market. Several substantial peaks brightened the price graph in June and September. The year culminated in the most famous cryptocurrency bull-run, which saw 90% of all coins reach their historical highs. Aeon was not an exception, reaching a legendary $9.45 mark in January 2018.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The glorious period did not last long, and the whole market started to deflate following Bitcoin&#8217;s trend. A correction phase kicked in, followed by a long-running stagnation. Many coins entered a downtrend that holds to this day. Even though the price of Aeon still exhibits a good ROI, it is not at all comparable to the highs of January 2018. After a continuous uprising of Summer-Autumn 2019, the coin is back to the values under 20 cents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has to be mentioned that, due to a comparatively low market capitalization of Aeon, it is hard to determine the exact cause of a given price movement. Furthermore, the project has very little publicity, which is why news about Aeon are not as readily accessible as for other famous cryptocurrencies. When no discernable news are available about the project, it is possible that coordinated pump-and-dump efforts are taking place, directly influencing the volatility of AEON. Naturally, Aeon needs to see increased adoption for some positive price movements to take place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The forecasts for Aeon are generally not very bright. For instance, WalletInvestor considers Aeon a bad short- or long-term investment, predicting a decrease in its price down to $0.00380 in one year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-aeon\">What is Aeon<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aeon (AEON) is a privacy-focused, open-source, decentralized digital currency. Similar to another privacy-focused coin, Monero (XMR), Aeon runs on the CryptoNote algorithm. However, unlike the latter, Aeon markets mobile-friendliness as one of it core features.&nbsp; In fact, Aeon is hard fork of Monero which was implemented by an anonymous developer back in 2014. A developer by the nickname &#8220;smooth&#8221; currently runs the project, but anyone is allowed to participate and contribute to the code. Unlike the majority of famous coins, Aeon does not have a public roadmap.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the prominent features of Aeon include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Security &#8211; every transaction in the system is secured with a robust cryptographic function and distributed in a global p2p consensus network;<\/li><li>Privacy &#8211; the cryptographic system used by AEON does not make any identifying information visible on the blockchain;<\/li><li>Untraceability &#8211; the use of ring signatures makes transactions on Aeon untraceable, meaning it is almost impossible to determine whether the funds have been spent.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"aeon-aeon-wallet\">Aeon (AEON) Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your crypto wisely!
