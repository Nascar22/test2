I am pretty sure it will be the next big thing\u00bb, that&#8217;s what Markus had tweeted in what could be considered a moment of boredom. The joking tweet and reference to Dogecoin &#8211; which still had not yet been created by Markus and Palmer &#8211; was meant to target\/criticize when new cryptocurrencies were being launched by the day, many of which had no intrinsic value or solid fundamentals, according to Palmer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we all know that fate loves irony, and that&#8217;s how a tweet about a crypto coin that was meant to be a prank managed instead to gain a lot of attention, traction &amp; followers. The same followers then encouraged Palmer and Markus to implement Dogecoin&#8217;s creation. Shortly after the tweet, dogecoin.com was born, and the website received more than 1 million visitors in the first month since its initial launch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Palmer&#8217;s tweet was then taken seriously by many crypto investors and fans, who decided, from that moment on, to fully embrace &#8220;the Doge&#8221; as one of their favorite cryptocurrencies, acclaiming it as &#8220;the next big thing&#8221; in the crypto-financial sector.<br>I<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>n the wake of this success, Palmer and his associate decided to build upon the public acclaim and validation by purchasing the dogecoin.com domain and creating the primogenitor Doge&#8217;s &#8220;viral logo,&#8221; as we know it today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-33397 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/image5.jpg\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The project was put to fruition in a short time but, despite Palmer and Markus riding the wave, they seemingly still considered it a &#8220;game&#8221;: therefore, the project cruised forward placidly &#8211; until social news aggregator Reddit and its community decide to &#8220;adopt&#8221; the $DOGE. Dogecoin&#8217;s subreddit rapidly reached peak subscription numbers and activity levels, thanks to implementing the so-called &#8220;Reddit Tip Bot.&#8221; This tool hugely boosted Dogecoin&#8217;s adoption by rewarding Reddit&#8217;s most active users and original content creators, and &#8211; in a concise amount of time &#8211; Dogecoin&#8217;s circulation bloomed and blossomed: from then on, virtually every Reddit user started earning and collecting his\/her $DOGEs and the &#8220;viral spiral&#8221; of the internet meme &amp; crypto communities took over.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, many initiatives have been launched by Dogecoin&#8217;s community of fans &#8211; some crazier than others, some audacious, some quite noble. These included the crowdfunding to help the Jamaican bobsled team join the So\u010di Winter Olympics, the Doge4Water initiative to help collect donations to build a well in the Tana river basin in Kenya Dogecoin&#8217;s NASCAR sponsorship banner over driver Josh Wise&#8217;s car.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And all these eventful happenings came to be way before Elon Musk &#8220;got elected&#8221; as Dogecoin&#8217;s CEO.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"all-hail-the-new-ceo\"><strong>\u201cAll Hail The New CEO!\u201d<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-33932 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/elon-musk-dogecoin-ceo.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The last sentence in the previous paragraph deserves some clarification, especially for anyone that, quite understandably, knows Elon Musk is renownedly Tesla and SpaceX CEO, but not Dogecoin&#8217;s.
