This value can be changed several times over a month. If over a month the price of a coin goes from $500 to $1500 to $400, then the All-Time High (ATH) is $1500.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The All-Time High is used to represent the theoretical maximum price that an asset could have been sold for. It also shows the maximum price that a potential buyer should have spent to buy an asset.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The All-Time High can be also used to create a comprehensive investment strategy. If an asset reaches its All-Time High price, then traders can see the upward trend and invest. However, it still requires fundamental analyses to determine when the trend changes and the price will start decreasing. Traders should consider the All-Time High as an additional factor that helps to create a correct investing strategy. The All-Time High shouldn\u2019t be used as the only factor that determines the investing strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If an asset reaches the All-Time High then more investors pay attention to it and see it as an investment option and it may lead to not only to investors number increasing, but also increasing the asset price and setting the new All-Time High.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\">Atomic wallet<\/a> provides you with the correct All-Time High, which will help you to create a comprehensive strategy and estimate your revenues from using a certain cryptocurrency.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The All-Time High can be used with fractions when it comes to cryptocurrencies. If 0.1 BTC (Bitcoin) was sold for $6000, then the All-Time High for Bitcoin is $60,000 even if only 0.1 BTC was ever sold for $6000.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The All-Time High concept can be used with the values of the market capitalization (market cap). The All-Time High market capitalization is based on the asset All-Time High price and the total number of assets.<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"The term \u201cAll-Time High\u201d is related to the highest price that an asset (it may be a share&hellip;\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":2581,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[14,112,1],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.4.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>All-Time High (ATH) - Cryptocurrency Guide<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"The term \u201cAll-Time High\u201d is related to the highest price that an asset (it may be a share or a cryptocurrency coin) has ever reached on the market.
