Currently, the XYO coin is listed only on three <a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/\">exchanges<\/a> and only one of them has almost 99% of circulation. The coin still has to prove itself as a competitive project in this highly-cramped industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-xyo\">What is XYO?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>XYO (XYO) is based on a distributed ledger technology network of physical devices. The main goal of the network is to store and verify all geo-related data of objects from the real world. In other words, XYO is like a blockchain version of the Internet of Things system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to CoinMarketCap, the XYO coin is on the five hundred eighty-sixth place in the top 1000 cryptocurrencies in the world by <a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/cryptocurrency-market-cap\">market cap<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The daily trading volume of the coin is approximately $2,300 USD or 0,3 Bitcoins (BTC).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two main features of this coin are that the coin was launched after the so-called \u201cthe crypto winter\u201d and it succeeded to reach its all-time-high (ATH) in December 2018.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current XYO <a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/cryptocurrency-rates\">price<\/a> is at $0,000313 USD (or 0,00000004 BTC) per 1 XYO. The total supply of XYO is equal to 14 198 847 000 coins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You <a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/how-to-store-private-keys-and-mnemonic-seed\">can store and exchange<\/a> the XYO in Atomic Wallet, a secure decentralized crypto wallet not only for traditional assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP) but also for the other 500+ tokens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"xyo-blockchain\">XYO Blockchain<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The XYO Network project was founded back in 2010 and it gives anyone a tool to access location-based technologies that connect the digital world to the physical world with the help of crypto algorithms. The network can interact with any <a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/smart-contracts\">smart contract<\/a>-supported open blockchain network just like Ethereum, EOS, NEO, Stellar, Cardano and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The XYO Network smart contract platform is using the Ethereum blockchain and yes, XYO is ERC-20 type coin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"xyo-price-chart\">XYO Price Chart<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/52zxUmp0rEsty1bw6noZfSSP8zBQkSotaN3OYqVThv11P8VQcwhJlTOdXm2MicmvV9ZZG0RWWjdorkB2lqXQbtQt8AEeOncmjUPtuy-rwhPcPTH4U1TbsIDkdaHrzAdkXHD3wNVd\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The XYO\u2019s ICO ended on May 20, 2018, and raised $12 million.
