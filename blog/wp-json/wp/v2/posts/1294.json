As of the beginning of July 2019, this cryptocurrency occupies the 20th position by market capitalization which stands at around 855 million USD. So, how does the Ethereum Classic Price Prediction look like?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the reversal of the trend on the cryptocurrency market in the second quarter of 2019, all major cryptocurrencies including Ethereum Classic are showing bullish dynamics in Q2 and Q3 of 2019 compared to Q3 and Q4 of 2018 and Q1 of 2019.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"technical-analysis-on-ethereum-classic-price-prediction\">Technical Analysis on Ethereum Classic Price Prediction<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In April 2019, ETC showed a sharp momentary rise to $8.08 by the Bitfinex quote, which collapsed after that for around 75% of its value in 17 days. In May 2019, there was found a support at $5.42, which coincided with at least two peaks at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 during the sideways trend at that time. The May support also coincided with the 50-period Moving Average on the daily timeframe bouncing off it twice with a false breakdown in the second time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In June 2019, the April high was toppled by another high at $9.85 (Bitfinex quote).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1188\"  height=\"849\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Technical Analysis on Ethereum Classic Price Prediction\"  class=\"wp-image-1295 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 1188px) 100vw, 1188px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/ethereum-classic-price-prediction-1.png\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/ethereum-classic-price-prediction-1.png 283w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/ethereum-classic-price-prediction-1.png 716w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/ethereum-classic-price-prediction-1.png 768w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/ethereum-classic-price-prediction-1.png 1511w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/ethereum-classic-price-prediction-1.png 1536w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/ethereum-classic-price-prediction-1.png 2048w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/ethereum-classic-price-prediction-1.png 380w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/ethereum-classic-price-prediction-1.png 1188w\" ><figcaption>Technical Analysis<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After the attainment of that level the price fell again to $6.67. Thus, the bullish trend continued with the supports forming above the previous ones. The latest high was at $9.85. After that there was a correction that continued the bullish trend using the 20-period Moving Average as a support on the daily timeframe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, that tendency was broken on June 27th, where the price fell below the 50-period Moving Average. And we can observe the forming of a downward crossover of the 20-period Moving Average through the 50-period Moving Average on the daily timeframe which is a certain marker of a bearish reversal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"more\">More<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking forward into Q4 2019. We can now assume that ETC has shown strong upward dynamics from its lows in the late 2018. That gives grounds for further growth throughout 2019 just according to the simple rule of trend momentum. Analyzing the future ETC price, we should still bear in mind the influence of Bitcoin on the entire market. Bitcoin, as of the beginning of July 2019, shows a typical Elliott formation. Currently standing at the beginning of the second corrective wave on the daily timeframe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1188\"  height=\"849\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Technical Analysis on Ethereum Classic Price Prediction\"  class=\"wp-image-1296 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 1188px) 100vw, 1188px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/ethereum-classicprice-prediction-2019.png\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/ethereum-classicprice-prediction-2019.png 283w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/ethereum-classicprice-prediction-2019.png 716w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/ethereum-classicprice-prediction-2019.png 768w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/ethereum-classicprice-prediction-2019.png 1511w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/ethereum-classicprice-prediction-2019.png 1536w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/ethereum-classicprice-prediction-2019.png 2048w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/ethereum-classicprice-prediction-2019.png 380w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/ethereum-classicprice-prediction-2019.png 1188w\" ><figcaption>Technical Analysis<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, we can rightfully expect the third motive wave, the most prominent motive wave, in August 2019 trough to Q4 2019. It will produce a substantial bullish impact on the entire cryptocurrency market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Important levels for ETC according to the Bitfinex quote currently are $5.81 (0.618), $6.58 (0.50) $8.31 (0.236), $5.63 (a daily support level).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/price-prediction\/ripple-price-prediction\"><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\">Read more on Ripple Price prediction<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"fundamental-analysis\">Fundamental analysis<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On July 1st, 2019 Ethereum Classic Labs announced a partnership with Metronome. It will provide \u2018chainhop\u2019 blockchain interoperability between the blockchains of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. This will allow to move Metronome tokens between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic blockchains.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This partnership is a part of a bigger upgrade called ECIP &#8212; 1054 (Atlantis). This upgrade aims at improving interoperability between the blockchains of ETH and ETC. Thereby, pulling the ETC blockchain up to the latest version of ETH protocol. This upgrade will enhance stability and security of ETC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"more-2\">More<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The implementation of Atlantis has been discussed with all the stakeholders in Ethereum Classic. So far, they have all agreed on this upgrade. The implementation is scheduled for the block 8,772,000, which will occur on September 17th, which will be a Tuesday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The implementation of Atlantis will be done by ETC Labs in cooperation with Metronome. Where the two companies will issue a cryptocurrency MET that will be transferable between the ETH and ETC blockchains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This update is believed to be a very important milestone in the development of the Ethereum Classic. It will soon grant this cryptocurrency a bigger share in the cryptocurrency market. Therefore, it is awaited with anticipation by many cryptocurrency experts and cryptocurrency market analysts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"verdict\">Verdict<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>ETC is currently (the beginning of July 2019) experiencing the influence of resistance at $9.85 with the buy sentiment being still predominant for the asset. However, it is advisable for position and long-term traders to buy ETC at the following levels: $5.56, $5.80, $6.66.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>with the target TP levels for Q4 2019 being at $14.40 and $17.43 on the Bitfinex chart.<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Ethereum Classic Price Prediction this year.
