Commonly known as &#8220;market cap,&#8221; it is calculated by multiplying the separate stocks of a company by one share&#8217;s present market price. As compared to using revenues or total asset numbers, the business group utilizes this figure to determine the size and power of a company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using market capitalization to demonstrate a company&#8217;s size is essential because the size of a firm is fundamental to multiple features that interest customers, including risks and dividends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"calculation\"><span id=\"how-to-calculate-the-cryptocurrency-market-cap\">How to calculate the Cryptocurrency Market Cap<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The market value of the equity of a company is the complete capitalization provided to a company by the investment public. Multiply the present market price of a company&#8217;s inventory by the entire amount of outstanding stocks to calculate this market value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number of outstanding shares is listed in the equity section of the balance sheet of a company. This calculation should apply to all exceptional inventory categories, such as prevalent stock and all favored inventory categories.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if a business has two million outstanding common shares and its current inventory trades at $30, then its equity market capitalization is $60,000,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"circulation-supply\"><span id=\"what-is-circulation-supply\">What is Circulation Supply?<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1300\"  height=\"480\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"circulation supply\"  class=\"wp-image-14580 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/cryptocurrency_market_capitalization_pic_circulation_supply.jpg\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/cryptocurrency_market_capitalization_pic_circulation_supply.jpg 1300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/cryptocurrency_market_capitalization_pic_circulation_supply-300x111.jpg 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/cryptocurrency_market_capitalization_pic_circulation_supply-768x284.jpg 768w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The word &#8220;circulation supply&#8221; refers to the number of cryptocurrency cards or tokens that are liberally accessible and floating around on the market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The circulating inventory of a cryptocurrency can increase or decrease over time. For example, the circulating supply of&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/bitcoin-wallet\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bitcoin<\/a>&nbsp;will gradually improve until a maximum amount of 21 million coins is reached.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mining technique, which generates new coins on average every 10 minutes, will imminently have to deal with such a gradual increase. Alternatively, in the event of coins burning themselves out, trading platforms are encouraged to remove them from the trading stock immediately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The flowing supply relates to the publicly available coins that shouldn&#8217;t be confused with the complete supply or max supply. Total supply is used to quantify the number of existing coins, i.e., the number of already issued coins minus the burned coins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, the complete stock is the amount of the flowing stock and the money tied up in the escrow. On the other hand, the maximum supply quantifies the maximum amount of coins that will ever exist, including the future coins that will be mined or made available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, a cryptocurrency&#8217;s running stock can be used to calculate its market capitalization, produced by multiplying the present market price by the amount of coins in circulation. So if some cryptocurrency has a circulating supply of 1,000,000 coins traded at $10 each, the market cap would be $10,000,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does it seem like a similar concept to market capitalization? Well, it is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/bitcoin-wallet\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BTC<\/a>&nbsp;\u2014 Bitcoin \u2014 $210,947,712,776<\/li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/ethereum-wallet\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ETH<\/a>&nbsp;\u2014 Ethereum \u2014 $22,691,365,044<\/li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/ripple-wallet\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">XRP<\/a>&nbsp;\u2014 Ripple \u2014 $12,823,698,445<\/li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/eos-wallet\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">EOS<\/a>&nbsp;\u2014 EOS \u2014 $3,647,160,679<\/li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/cardano-wallet\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ADA<\/a>&nbsp;\u2014 Cardano \u2014 $1,266,548,228<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"importance\"><span id=\"why-is-market-cap-so-important\">Why is Market Cap so important?<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1300\"  height=\"480\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-14592 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/cryptocurrency_market_capitalization_pic_supply.jpg\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/cryptocurrency_market_capitalization_pic_supply.jpg 1300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/cryptocurrency_market_capitalization_pic_supply-300x111.jpg 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/cryptocurrency_market_capitalization_pic_supply-768x284.jpg 768w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, it enables shareholders to comprehend one company&#8217;s relative size versus another. Market cap measures what a business is worth on the open market, as well as the perception of the market&#8217;s potential opportunities because it represents what shareholders are prepared to pay for their inventory. They are often dominant competitors in developed sectors, and a domestic customer public may be acquainted with their brand names.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, mid-cap businesses are typically between $2 billion and $10 billion in market value. These are typically founded firms in sectors that are undergoing or anticipated to grow rapidly. These medium-sized enterprises may be in the phase of growing market share and general competitiveness improvement. This development phase is probable to determine whether a business will ultimately live up to its complete capacity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thirdly, small-cap businesses typically range from $300 million to $2 billion in market value. These are generally youthful firms serving niche markets or developing sectors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"crypto-price\"><span id=\"how-supply-affects-the-price-of-the-cryptocurrency\">How supply affects the price of the cryptocurrency<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1300\"  height=\"480\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-14604 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/cryptocurrency_market_capitalization_why_market_cap_is_important.jpg\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/cryptocurrency_market_capitalization_why_market_cap_is_important.jpg 1300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/cryptocurrency_market_capitalization_why_market_cap_is_important-300x111.jpg 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/cryptocurrency_market_capitalization_why_market_cap_is_important-768x284.jpg 768w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lower supply can imply increased demand, leading to higher rates. They also claim that this sets crypto aside from the worldwide economic scheme, whereby key banks can efficiently store more cash through a policy known as a monetary adjustment, which can contribute to inflation, meaning that the currency in your pocket is not worth as much as it once was.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But some critics contend that fixed deliveries effectively prevent individuals from expenditure in terms of cryptocurrencies attaining widespread acceptance, implying that digital assets are speculative investments that individuals hoard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When an asset is limited, depreciation is inevitable, and this generates a risk for crypto holders waiting to make their products cheaper. Inflation is something that discourages customers from holding onto their money when it comes to standard currencies\u2014 the longer it&#8217;s in their purse, the less buying capacity it has.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1300\"  height=\"480\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-14616 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/cryptocurrency_market_capitalization_pic_how_supply_affects.jpg\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/cryptocurrency_market_capitalization_pic_how_supply_affects.jpg 1300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/cryptocurrency_market_capitalization_pic_how_supply_affects-300x111.jpg 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/cryptocurrency_market_capitalization_pic_how_supply_affects-768x284.jpg 768w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While market cap is a useful metric for guessing how vital a cryptocurrency is, several other variables must be taken into consideration.
