Stellar current price is $0,0594. The all-time high was fixed on January the 4th, 2018 when XLM price reached $0,9381. The all-time low was $0,0012 in November 2014. It\u2019s remarkable that Stellar is one of the most quickly-growing cryptos \u2014 it has 1 911,59% ROI if counted from the XLM price at the point of release. On top of that, Stellar had the second most successful ICO after Ethereum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Stellar had its price skyrocketing at the end of 2017 and the whole of 2018. It happened after the project made a hype wave by announcing the partnership program with IBM. A bit earlier the same year McCaleb had a speech at a blockchain conference where he confirmed that 30 banks signed in the Stellar program. That all gathered enormously big interest around the project which pumped the Stellar price up high.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"stellar-news\">Stellar News<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There was plenty of news on Stellar and its price in 2018 and 2019. There were also a lot of predictions of Stellar\u2019s future price and, in addition, a lot of hype.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"stellar-project-burns-55-billion-coins\">Stellar Project Burns 55 Billion Coins<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At the beginning of November 2019, the foundation got 55 billion tokens burned in order to keep the net efficient. The current price of XLM was $0.085, so the burned tokens were equal to approximately $4.7 billion. The community reacted positively and the price had a 25% rise on the same day, indicating a great demand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"tron-and-stellar-founded-blockchain-education-alliance\">Tron and Stellar Founded Blockchain Education Alliance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the press release from October 2019 two of the top crypto projects made an agreement. They made a partnership in order to create an educational program that will provide universities with contemporary knowledge about blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"stellar-removes-inflation\">Stellar Removes Inflation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In September 2019 Stellar released an update that removed the inflation feature from the blockchain. The update note said that the inflation was initially designed to gain additional funds from the community payouts but it didn\u2019t work out well. As a result, users voted for this decision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"stellar-xlm-price-forecasts\">Stellar (XLM) Price Forecasts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"coinpredictor\">Coinpredictor<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/ZubMaGeCNoPc2a__dt_D7GKbn5ys7YEWuu1viayrUrWFzxttBjyFJkbgaB22kepPXJXCgQDwyliFMkXly6H5oIuKqaQ2Ty6hYAAfxVl-GE79smOjNXm-NZ4rLKe8Oj0O5FJSpBVV\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cryptocurrency prediction and analysis portal Coinpredictor has a negative forecast on Stellar coin price.

But some still believe in the foundation and what they do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"stellar-xlm-price-prediction-verdict\">Stellar (XLM) Price Prediction Verdict<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stellar is quite a unique project. It is known by high ideals in their goals and policy. If they go on building a platform that will allow transacting funds all over the world in a snap with almost zero fees, XLM will obviously gain strength and grow. It is already one of the most successful cryptocurrencies with solid support, but it can go even higher.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, if you want to get XLM and gain profit from the investment, you need to buy and store the coin. That\u2019s why you need a reliable wallet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-stellar-xlm\">What is Stellar (XLM)?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stellar is a decentralized global payment system. It is based on an open-source blockchain platform. Stellar\u2019s main function is money transactions all over the world featuring low fees and high speed. The native cryptocurrency is called Stellar Lumen also known as XLM. Initially, it was the only one available for transfers. But later on, the project developed its partnership network involving banks (Deloitte Digital Bank, India\u2019s ICICI Bank), fiat payment services (Coins.ph) and IT companies e.g. IBM and Vumi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stellar was released on July 31, 2014. In the very beginning, it was technically a Ripple hard fork. It\u2019s not a surprise because Stellar\u2019s founder Jed McCaleb is also a co-founder of the Ripple project. A bit later after the fork took place Stellar blockchain got its own working algorithm \u2014 SCP or Stellar Consensus Protocol. At that point, the project moved to its own platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The protocol serves the main idea of the project which is providing people worldwide quick and cheap money transferring platforms. The background behind the project is very simple: banks and other financial intermediaries are slow, expensive and sometimes are not too friendly. Blockchain technologies can solve that, so the creators just put one and one together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"technical-and-organization-features\">Technical and Organization Features<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Stellar blockchain works with the Proof-of-Work algorithm. But, as was mentioned, the work is based on the unique protocol. It manages nodes dividing them into clusters. If a transaction must be confirmed, it\u2019s delegated to a group. The whole net doesn\u2019t have to confirm the same block. As a result, the longest possible transaction time is 5 seconds. No bank or payment service can offer such figures. This blockchain can process 1,000 operations per second.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike Ripple, Stellar made their source code open from the very beginning. They also developed and applied several rules of the blockchain and organization in order to gain users\u2019 trust. Among them are periodical reports of the work, public budgeting and denying the policy of privileged users. Stellar is fully distributed and owned by the community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-buy-and-store-stellar\">How to Buy and Store Stellar<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best solutions for managing crypto portfolio is the Atomic wallet.

All the key data is encrypted and secured on several levels. Private user keys always remain on the device and can\u2019t wind up in someone else\u2019s hands. Atomic wallet cares about their users\u2019 funds really much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-exchange-stellar\">How to Exchange Stellar<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, Atomic wallet allows exchanging assets quick and easy.
