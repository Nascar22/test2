The circulating supply is 100,803,052 WAVES, which is also the maximum possible supply. The daily trading volume is around $55,561,860 or 7,017 BTC. The most active exchange that trades WAVES is Binance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-time high of Waves, $18.07, was reached on December 19, 2017 &#8211; during the most famous cryptocurrency bull-run of Winter 2017-2018. On the other hand, the all-time low of WAVES, $0.122684, occurred way back on August 2, 2016. Currently, the estimated ROI (return on investment) of Waves is -31.20%, which means that $100 worth of WAVES bought at the time of the Waves launch would not yield any profit today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Waves first started trading, the price was slightly above $1. The competitive environment and skepticism that dominated the cryptocurrency industry at the time hampered its growth and led to a year-long stagnation phase, during which the price of the coin dod did not experience significant changes. Everything changed in May 2017, when the cryptocurrency market entered the famous uptrend. It has to be noted that WAVES did not just mirror the Bitcoin price chart: significant improvements in the codebase and the growing popularity of the platform itself hugely contributed to the price increase. The continuous growth phase culminated in a historical high of Waves in December 2017, after which the coin entered a correction phase in line with the general downtrend on the cryptocurrency market.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has to be noted that Waves is capable of showing remarkable resilience against market fluctuations. For instance, after the biggest bull-run in the history of cryptocurrency, Waves experienced a decrease in price throughout the entire 2018. While the rise experienced by WAVES was proportional to the overall trend on the market, the damaging effect of the correction phase was not as strong for WAVES as for some other popular coins. For instance, the price of Zcash decreased by a factor of 12 in the same time period. Evidence also shows that Waves is capable of recovering pretty fast.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept and architecture of Waves are universally acknowledged, which might be a good sign of its growth. Even though Waves is not the most common cryptocurrency, it can always be traded on DEX for any other currency. Furthermore, Waves has recently established agreements with some major organizations such as Microsoft, Russian Gazprombank, and the Moscow Stock Exchange to use WAVES Coin as a payment method.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, the WAVES growing potential is not as dependent on the market fluctuations as the majority of coins. The supply of WAVES is limited to only 100 000 000 tokens, which provides some extent of protection against inflation. Some positive forecasts (CoinPredictor) predict the increase in WAVES price up to $4 in 2020. The overall consensus is the prediction of a bright future for this unusual cryptocurrency.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-waves\">What is WAVES<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WAVES is a digital currency associated with the blockchain-based crowdfunding platform Waves. It can be used to create custom tokens, decentralized applications (DApps), and mediate transactions. Founded by a Russian physicist and entrepreneur Alexander Ivanov, it is a blockchain analog of the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WAVES Coin is the platform&#8217;s internal token, which is used for all kinds of operations: transfer, withdrawal, and trading of assets. Unlike Ethereum, its primary competitor, it actually utilizes the Proof-of-Stake hash algorithm, meaning it does not involve mining. This confers Waves with more scalability. The programming language of the Waves platform is Scala.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Waves launched the world&#8217;s first and fastest decentralized exchange, DEX. The exchange can be used to trade any pair of tokens directly without utilizing intermediate currencies. Trading on DEX is thought to be safer than centralized exchanges since there is no need to withdraw any funds from your wallet. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Waves Price 2020 The current price of Waves fluctuates around $0.914150; the total market capitalization is $92,149,094 or&hellip;\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[167],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.4.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Waves Price | WAVES Charts | WAVES Value<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Get the most accurate info about WAVES Price (WAVES), price chart, trade volume, market cap and more.
