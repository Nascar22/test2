The circulating supply is 10,786,831 DCR.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-time high of Decred, $99.74, was reached in April 2018. The approximate ROI (return on investment) of DCR is 1,713.35%, which means that 1 DCR bought at the time of Decred launch in 2016 would yield $1,713 today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most significant increase in the price of DCR occurred in early 2017, after which it grew relatively steadily till summer 2018. That was when the overall stagnation in the crypto market affected the rate of almost every coin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The overall history of the DCR was not the most stable one: right after launch in 2016, the price slowly dropped both in relation to USD and BTC. In early 2017 the price started to go up steadily before reaching its all-time high relative to Bitcoin &#8211; around 0.0178. Another gid jump occurred in March 2017, when Decred (DCR) was added to the HolyTransaction wallet.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the majority of digital currencies, the all-time high of Decred was reached in January 2018, when the whole crypto-market was in a bullish cycle. In just a few months, the DCR price went up by more than 200%; however, it did not take long for it to drop back when the stagnation period on the market began.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the overall consensus on the superior technology and concept of the coin, a lot of community members think it is underestimated and can thus be an excellent long-term investment. Not every coin can offer advantages as diverse as the support of atomic swaps, maximum decentralization, reliable governance system, competent development team, and support of the Lightning Network. However, the control model of Decred remains its main advantage, providing an optimal level of decentralization while considering the user interests.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decred has received a lot of appraisal and support from the top members of the community, including Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin. With all this in mind, it is thus entirely reasonable to see positive forecasts for the future of DCR. According to CoinSwitch, a 5-year long investment in DCR could yield as much as 1557.697898% profit, while in 2020, its price could get up to $26. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-decred-nbsp\">What is Decred?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Decred (DCR; short for Decentralised Credit) is a decentralized open-source digital currency and a Bitcoin fork, which was created in an attempt to solve the problem of blockchain governance. Launched in February 2016 by a group of developers behind btcsuite, it adopted the most useful features of Bitcoin and combined those with cross-chain atomic swaps, limited impact of miners, and better governance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as Bitcoin, Decred has a limited supply of 21 million DCR. Led by a team of former Bitcoin developers, Decred was conceived to get rid of the governance issues of Bitcoin. This goal was finally achieved in 2017 when an update called Decred 1.0.0 featured a hybrid PoW\/PoS consensus mechanism.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some other distinct advantages of Decred (DCR) include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A unique hybrid between the two consensus mechanisms &#8211; Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS);<\/li><li>A blockchain-based public proposal platform which is resistant to censorship;<\/li><li>Reliable smart contracts, for example, Lightning Network;&nbsp;<\/li><li>Cross-chain atomic swaps between different cryptocurrencies.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A prominent feature of Decred is its extreme community-drivenness. Decred operates on a contractor&#8217;s model, meaning it allows new companies and individuals to contribute to the project. The PoS DCR stakeholders can vote on budget proposals and code updates through a blockchain-based public voting system called Politeia, which was implemented in October 2018. Furthermore, a team of more than 14 developers ensures constant development, maintenance, and troubleshooting. The roadmap features are incorporated into Decred&#8217;s open-source and free software almost every day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"decred-wallet\">Decred Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your crypto wisely!
