We have partners who don&#8217;t talk to us at all. Basically, if you&#8217;d like to use our API or any other affiliate tool, the only time you have to reach out to us is if you&#8217;d like to change the affiliate fee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were glad to host <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/changenow_io\">ChangeNOW<\/a> on our Telegram.
