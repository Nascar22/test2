The circulating supply is 109,006,117 ETH.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-time high of Ethereum, $1,432.88, was reached in January 2018. The estimated ROI (return on investment) of ETH is 4,633.32%, which means that $100 worth of ETH bought at the time of the Ethereum launch would yield $4633 today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The value of Ethereum (ETH) comes from the numerous ways it is used: to pay transaction fees inside Ethereum blockchain; as a payment option in many stores or service providers; as an entry gateway for decentralized exchanges (DEX), Ethereum-based tokens, DApps, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having peaked at $1,100 in January 2018, ETH has recently been hovering around $150. Ethereum price has been continuously declining without significant ups, and this can sometimes lead to negative forecasts. Nonetheless, there are good enough reasons to assume that the price of ETH will recover soon.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the majority of cryptocurrencies, 2018 has been a challenging year with dominating bearish trends. At the end of 2018, Ethereum (ETH) was even displaced to the third position in the overall cryptocurrency list but managed to recover soon in the first quarter of 2019.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The increase in the number of Ethereum adopters is predicted to strengthen its position on the market and increase its value. Besides, with the upcoming updates announced by Buterin this year, Ethereum is getting a lot of attention. The release of Ethereum 2.0 and significant changes such as the transition to proof-of-stake consensus mechanism with more scalability and energy efficiency might lead to the recovery of a $1000 mark price.&nbsp; <a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/ethereum-price-prediction\">Read more&#8230;<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-ethereum-eth\">What is Ethereum (ETH)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/ethereum-wallet\">Ethereum (ETH)<\/a> is a crypto-asset generated by the Ethereum platform, a public open-source blockchain-based computing platform and operating system. Conceived as an evolution of Bitcoin&#8217;s technology, Ethereum not only enabled anonymous transactions but also introduced the concept of smart contracts. Apart from being a cryptocurrency, Ethereum is also a programming language that allows developers to build their own code.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, Ethereum diverged into two separate blockchains &#8211; Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). With a market capitalization of $19 billion, ETH remains the second most popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, notably differing from it in a much faster transaction speed (10-15 seconds as opposed to 15 minutes for BTC).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with Bitcoin, ETH is used to compensate for computations performed during mining. Ethereum was proposed in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a cryptocurrency researcher and cryptographer, and implemented a year later. Ethereum is implemented in C++, Go, and Rust programming languages, utilizes the Ethash hash algorithm and Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, and supports Turing-complete smart contracts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ethereum enables Smart Contracts and Distributed Applications (DApps) to be created and used without control or interference from a third party. In a Smart Contract, the participants agree on the conditions that are embedded straight into the code. The Smart Contract itself is implemented according to the instructions, thus ensuring that no party can cheat on the other.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, Ethereum split into two separate blockchains &#8211; Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). The reason behind the split was the theft of $50 million worth of ETH from the DAO, a set of Ethereum-based smart contracts. The community vote decided to introduce several security-related changes into the blockchain, which would enable the return of the stolen funds. However, a considerable part of the community was against the update, insisting on the principle of the immutability of a blockchain. Thus, Ethereum as we know it is, in fact, a hard fork from the original blockchain, which remained unchanged and got the addition &#8220;Classic.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"ethereum-wallet\">Ethereum Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your crypto wisely!
