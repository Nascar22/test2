The circulating supply is 43,145,015,724 TEL, while the total supply is 100,000,000,000 TEL. The daily trading volume is around $106,750 or 13.45980776 BTC. The most active exchange that trades TEL is KuCoin.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-time high of Telcoin, $0.011780, was reached on January 20, 2018 &#8211; during the most famous cryptocurrency bull-run of Winter 2017-2018. On the other hand, the all-time low of TEL, $0.000215, occurred fairly recently on January 23, 2019. Currently, the estimated ROI (return on investment) of Telcoin is -93.20%, which means that $100 worth of TEL bought at the time of the Telcoin launch would not yield any profit today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A promising feature of Telcoin is the way it aims to connect some of the most trending industries &#8211; telecommunications and cryptocurrencies. However, the development of TEL has been struggling to compete with the emerging competitors in the cryptocurrency market, which is why a downtrend has dominated the price chart for a long time. According to WalletInvestor, a 1-year forecast for TEL is $0.000081, which makes it a bad long-term investment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-telcoin-tel\">What is Telcoin (TEL)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Telcoin (TEL) is a Singapore-based blockchain project and an eponymous cryptocurrency of an ERC20 standard. Optimized for mobile phones, Telcoin is a user-friendly platform for international money transfers, mobile top-ups, roaming spending, and more. Telcoin aims to partner with telecommunication giants like AT&amp;T and Verizon for wider adoption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of Telcoin lies in the fact that there are almost five times more mobile phones in the world than there are bank accounts (5 billion vs. 1.2 billion, respectively). Mobile services are way more easily accessible than banking services, especially in some of the developing countries; the aim of Telcoin is to capitalize on the disparity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"telcoin-tel-wallet\">Telcoin (TEL) Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your crypto wisely!
