ETH volume in 24 hours is about $ 3 BLN. It takes second place in the top 10 cryptocurrencies in the world. Ethereum is also one of the most valuable currencies and ETH current price is about 130 USD for 1 ETH.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ethereum-price-today\">Ethereum Price Today<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ethereum prices are falling and at this moment the ETH current price is around 130 USD. Should to say that at the beginning of a 2018 Ethereum price in USD was about $ 1200. From these facts comes that the Ethereum coin price lost more than 90% of the maximum value for now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ethereum-market-prediction\"><span id=\"market-prediction-for-ethereum-eth-price\">Market Prediction for Ethereum (ETH) Price<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The most popular Ethereum news is spinning around the ETH price. The analytics continue to talk about the falling of Ethereum price and trying to conclude Ethereum price prediction. Actually, the ETH price goes down faster, then the price of the other top tokens.  This fact has surprised the experts and the question, where Ethereum price is heading is still opened. Here are some expert opinions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>#1 CoinDesk ETH Price Prediction<br>Price is struggling with falling resistance. If ETH price can break above, $ 114 is likely. If not, another lower low looks likely near prior support $ 98 for one ETH.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>#2 Chris McClure ETH Price Prediction<br>Whether it&#8217;s Sharding, Plasma, or OpenST Mosaic, there are tremendous technological reasons to be bullish on Ethereum volume and to believe in a speculatively high ETH price moving in 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>#3 Brian Schuster ETH Price Prediction<br>Ark Capital LLC founder, Brian Schuster believes that Ethereum price may reach $ 100,000 in another 5 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ethereum-price-prediction\">Ethereum Price Prediction<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The last time Ethereum price being so low was in 2017. A time ETH formed the support of $ 91. Looking for Ethereum news you can find the opinions that there is a risk for Ethereum price to go even lower in 2019. The last support area for the crypto was at the $ 100 position and it can easily come down to $ 90 again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, during the day of December 17, the value of the cryptocurrency market increased sharply: in an hour it grew by $ 4 billion and now amounts to $109 billion in a sum. Most cryptos went up in a short period of time: the price of Bitcoin rose by 5%, XRP by 4%, Stellar by 6%, EOS by 11%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that there was a good Ethereum news: The average market rate of Ethereum was increased to $ 141 on Dec 24 and up to $ 158 on Jan 6. But after that, it started to fall again and at this moment Ethereum coin price is somewhere between 100-120 USD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1355\"  height=\"403\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Ethereum History Price\"  class=\"wp-image-14265 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 1355px) 100vw, 1355px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/ethereum-price-december-2019.png\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/ethereum-price-december-2019.png 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/ethereum-price-december-2019.png 1024w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/ethereum-price-december-2019.png 768w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/ethereum-price-december-2019.png 1920w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/ethereum-price-december-2019.png 1536w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/ethereum-price-december-2019.png 2048w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/ethereum-price-december-2019.png 380w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/ethereum-price-december-2019.png 1355w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"price-forecast\"><span id=\"ethereum-price-forecast\">Ethereum Price Forecast<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The forecast for Ethereum price depends on the events planned by the network developers for 2019 and announced by Vitalik Buterin in the spring of this year.

Indeed, in this country, there was a considerable number of Ethereum coin users. In this way the Chinese authorities want to cut off all foreign projects from the country, giving more chances for the development of their own cryptocurrency project that is called NEO.
