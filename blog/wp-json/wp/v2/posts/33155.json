Stellar is well-known for its payment and digital currency solution it is providing to enterprises and individuals across the globe. The Stellar blockchain-based payment system supports the creation, management, and exchange of digital representations of any form of money.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By design, the Stellar protocol works with a unique token known as the<em>&nbsp;lumen<\/em>&nbsp;(XLM). As the native&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/what-is-cryptocurrency\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cryptocurrency<\/a>&nbsp;of the Stellar network, it is incumbent on every account on the network to hold a small amount of XLM at all times. To mitigate the misuse of the network by bad actors, the lumen was issued to denominate network requirements and transaction fees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current stellar price is a little above $0.32 per coin and with a market capitalization of $7,124,896,216, making it the eleventh largest cryptocurrency in the world. XLM is up 142.4% in the last 30 days and 425.% in a year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of this piece, we expect to know what Stellar protocol is, what the team is up to, future XLM price predictions according to experts, and several exciting facts, including the latest Stellar news.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-stellar-xlm\"><strong>What is Stellar (XLM)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The stellar network is an open-source and public-owned payment system for storing and moving digital assets. In its early stages, the network was poised to help users send and receive cross-border payments at very competitive fees. Eventually, Stellar stepped up its game to build a network of financial institutions that can work together using blockchain technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jed McCaleb, founder of Mt. Gox (a then bitcoin exchange) and Co-founder of Ripple, teamed up with former lawyer Joyce Kim in 2014 to launch the Stellar network. At its launch, Stellar received an amount of $3 million in seed funding from Stripe, a financial service company, and since then, the project has grown in all aspects. Since its inception, Stellar has witnessed a significant increase in the number of global financial partners. It has also processed over 450 million operations by more than four million individual accounts and several other fascinating milestones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike other blockchains, Stellar works in a unique way. Stellar blockchain relies on independent computers in its network to oversee others&#8217; works without any central entity. These nodes ensure verification and update the ledgers every five seconds making Stellar one of the fastest blockchains for transactions. Stellar uses a unique consensus algorithm known as the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP). In comparison to Bitcoin&#8217;s Proof-of-work, SCP is much faster, configurable, and energy-efficient,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lumen (XLM) is the native cryptocurrency of the Stellar protocol, mostly used to fuel transactions on the network. It also serves to prevent malicious actors who might want to take advantage of the network. XLM is an integral part of the universal payment system for digital money, Stellar. The XLM crypto has a circulating supply of 22 Billion XLM and a max supply of 50 Billion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stellar&#8217;s notable features include an asset exchange that users can seamlessly use to exchange digital assets like cryptocurrencies, forex, and securities. It also comes with a payment application for swift and cost-effective cross-border payments, an initiative to support the network and ecosystem&#8217;s contributors through voting, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"stellar-xlm-price-chart\"><strong>Stellar (XLM) Price Chart<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-33156 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Stellar-XLM-Price-Chart.jpg\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"market-prediction-for-stellar-xlm-price-2021\"><strong>Market prediction for Stellar (XLM) price 2021<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Analysts, price prediction websites, and retail traders have their predictions for XLM in the year 2021. While there might be variation, we must have different and distinct views on XLM price. This will help in making better financial decisions. Now let&#8217;s take a closer look at what these experts have to say about Stellar price USD in 2012:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"longforecast-stellar-price-prediction-2021\"><strong>LongForecast Stellar Price Prediction 2021<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-33167 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/LongForecast-Stellar-Price-Prediction-20210A.jpg\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Longforecast prediction agency for digital assets expects XLM to be trading between the $0.29 &#8211; $0.40 range by March. Stellar price USD will reach $0.37 by early August while closing around $0.31 per coin. In December 2021, XLM price will be ranging between $0.33 &#8211; $0.39 per Longforecast&#8217;s XLM price analysis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"ripple-coin-news-stellar-price-prediction-2021\"><strong>Ripple Coin News Stellar Price Prediction 2021<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Ripple Coin News, a Ripple and crypto-focused news portal, is also making a bullish stance on Stellar price in 2021. Stellar value will be somewhere between the $0.30 &#8211; $0.50 price range according to the platform. Overall, they are optimistic regarding Stellar price in the interim and beyond.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"trading-beats-stellar-price-prediction-2021\"><strong>Trading Beats Stellar Price Prediction 2021<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-33178 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Trading-Beats-Stellar-Price-Prediction-20210A.jpg\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tradingbeats is one of the famous price prediction platforms for various digital assets. As per the projection made by Tradingbeats, Steller price is forecasted to reach $0.38 by the beginning of March and close to a few cents above the opening price of March. By December, they expect XLM to be trading at an average price of $0.41<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"monetize-info-stellar-price-prediction-2021\"><strong>Monetize.Info Stellar Price Prediction 2021<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Monetize believes Stellar&#8217;s financial partners will have a significant impact on Stellar price USD in 2021. Stellar currently has big brands onboard and more coming in due course. Ripple happens to be one of Stellar&#8217;s competitors, and their (Ripple) ongoing lawsuit with the SEC might allow Stellar to grab some of the market shares. Monetize is projecting XLM to surpass its previous all-time high (ATH) of $0.60 by the end of the year with all these variables.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"walletinvestor-stellar-price-prediction-2021\"><strong>WalletInvestor Stellar Price Prediction 2021<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Walletinvestor&#8217;s website, which updates Stellar price prediction every three minutes and based on technical analysis, they believe XLM is not an excellent long-term investment. However, they anticipate the Stellar coin price to be somewhere around $ 0.34 by December 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"stellar-price-prediction-2021\"><strong>Stellar price prediction 2021<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Stellar happens to be one of the big names when it comes to cryptocurrency. In an interview with CoinMarketCap last year, McCaleb explained the idea behind Stellar, which I believe summarizes all that the project is up to. He explained: &#8220;The whole original design of Stellar is that you can have fiat currencies and other kinds of forms of value run in parallel with each other and with crypto assets. This is super important to drive this stuff mainstream.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>About his explanation, Stellar, in some sense, can be related to Ripple as they are both payment-oriented. Stellar was initially based on Ripple Lab protocol, and along the line, the code was rewritten. Steller finds itself in a very competitive market, including traditional payment systems. Ripple, for instance, is thriving and growing steadily regardless of its issues with the SEC. Ripple has now overtaken Polkadot to secure the 4th position of top cryptocurrencies according to market cap. These external factors will have an immense influence on Stellar&#8217;s growth. They are subsequently reflecting in Stellar current price performance in the coming years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fundamentally, Stellar is way ahead of most of its competitors. It&#8217;s relatively cheaper (0.00001 XLM per transaction) and faster to send and receive cross-border payment than available solutions. The outbreak of the noble Coronavirus has led state heads, tech gurus, and medical experts to advocate and encourage the use of digital forms of payment in all of our financial dealings, if possible. This has once again reminded us of the essence of solutions like that of Stellars&#8217;, and as a result, people have grown interests in digital forms of payments. Stellar is likely to benefit as it has long before entered other regions, including Africa, South America, Asia, etc. This will get Stellar the needed exposure, and eventually, as more people get to invest in the currency, XLM price is bound to appreciate with time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, the ecosystem of users and partners building on Stellar has grown massively since it launched. At the time of writing, Stellar has processed over 2.5 million operations in just 24hours, indicating how the network has improved over time. Stellar is an open financial infrastructure that helps large enterprise companies and developers build sophisticated financial products on its network. Notable top-brands onboarded and leveraging Stellar protocol include IBM, Bitbond, Bankhaus von der Heydt, SatoshiPay, Abra, and several others. The number of partners is expected to increase with measures being put in place to onboarded new entrants.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Stellar should keep working on its ecosystem, It won&#8217;t be a surprise to see a surge above Stellar current price. We might see XLM at $0.50 by June and possibly climbing to $1 by the end of 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"stellar-price-prediction-2025\"><strong>Stellar price prediction 2025<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is no surprise that experts have made different XLM price predictions for 2025. What we can deduce from the numerous XLM price predictions is that the majority is predicting in favor of a bullish market for XLM. Some forecasting platforms predict XLM to reach $0.7 &#8211; $0.79, which is realistic considering the time interval. The likes of CoinSwitch and Coinpedia are very optimistic about XLM trading around $5 in 2025.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"stellar-price-prediction-verdict\"><strong>Stellar price prediction verdict<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Stellar has been fantastic throughout the years, and it&#8217;s still relevant as of today. Most analysts are tipping as the catalyst that will drive XLM price to do with Stellar&#8217;s partners. Stellar has partnered with some top financial and tech companies, including IBM, Deloitte, Swipe, and others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Early this year, the Ukraine government chose Stellar blockchain to deploy a central bank digital currency (CBDC) after several research years. Stellar is continuously reaching out to other governments and institutions that might consider building CBDCs on the network. When the numbers increase, Stellar coin price is likely to respond accordingly because most investors consider this fundamental analysis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A critical evaluation of various opinions on Stellar coin price in the future indicates a very successful year for Stellar.
