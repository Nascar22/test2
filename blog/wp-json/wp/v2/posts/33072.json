He is a former team member at OKCoin Exchange as the CTO in 2014. Binance Coin is the best exchange token amongst its peers in the crypto market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Binance Coin majorly started as an exchange token for receiving discounts in fees on Binance trading platforms. It can also be used across grocery stores for merchants who accept BNB for payment. The token allows its holders to participate in Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) done on Binance.com. Binance Coin later launched its blockchain, the Binance Chain, in April 2019. Its primary focus is to facilitate fast, decentralized (or non-custodial) trading.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later in 2020, Binance launched the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The mainnet took off in September 2020, since it was announced in April 2020. BSC is the parallel blockchain to Binance Chain that will enable smart contracts and the staking mechanism for BNB. BSC allows the creation of smart contract tokens (Bep20) on BSC. There are numerous other features of Binance Coin, which include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility for developers.<\/li><li>A high-speed smart contract enabled blockchain for fast transactions on smart contract calls.&nbsp;<\/li><li>The fee charges on Binance smart chain are minimal against its competitor, Ethereum.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus mechanism.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These features made it a top alternative to the Ethereum network. In what many experts refer to the blockchain for all. This is because the Ethereum blockchain charges high fees for smart contract executions, majorly on Automated Market Maker Protocols, making it a platform for those &#8220;who can afford the fees.&#8221; But BSC, which is EVM compatible, charges minimal fees for the same smart contract execution, making a platform for &#8220;all types of traders.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"binance-coin-price-chart-nbsp\"><strong>Binance Coin Price Chart:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-33074 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Binance-Coin-Price-Chart.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Binance coin entered the market on July 25, 2017, with the trading price above the price at Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Later on, the price started to improve and reached $3 at the end of August. With specific market effects, BNB ended 2017 with a trading price of $8.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since its launch in 2017, the Binance coin has performed well, serving as an exchange discount and service token. The first significant increase in the Binance Coin Price was in 2017 after listing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Binance first listed BNB for trading on July 14, 2017, and the token has achieved a nearly 9,600 percent return on investment from its December 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) price of $0.10.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Binance Coin, coin price in January 2018 opened on level ground at $23.25, which is the highest price the coin reached until 2020. This was a fantastic phase for Binance investors around the crypto world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Feb 2018, most of the coins recorded a big decline in price in what experts called the bear market trend. The table turned down the Binance coin. The price declined below $6.12 in early February 2020. This was more like a discount to investors considering the current price of one BNB.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But later, in late June 2018, the BNB coin price increased up to 200%. Binance coin price continued to shine in late June 2018 with $16.71 per one. Calculating its performance to other exchange tokens, you will realize that it was a good investment for most investors who bought.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In February 2021, Binance Coin reached a new all-time high, double the previous all-time high in 2018 and 2019. For those who suffered in the 2018 bear market, 2021 is your year of golden opportunity. The Binance coin&#8217;s current price is already on popular Binance Coin news channels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current market capitalization is $9.10 billion, while the Binance Coin&#8217;s current price trades at $59.01 at writing. BNB is also currently the ninth-largest crypto in the world by market capitalization.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Binance Coin&#8217;s current price at the time of writing is above its previous all-time high (ATH). It recorded a new all-time high this February at $59.37, according to Coinmarketcap data. The Binance Coin price USD target for most predictions in 2021 ranges around $70 &#8211; $100. We might see a price half of the previous ATH above the Binance Coin current price before the end of the year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Market prediction for Binance Coin (BNB) price 2021:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Binance coin predictions currently don&#8217;t seem to be a difficult prediction. Based on fundamentals, the crypto coin will increase more in the coming years. While many experts believe it will grow on value. Some others claim that it will be based on the adoption of BSC, while others claim that Ethereum will combat the new issues it&#8217;s facing regarding high fees to retain its top position. The current ATH now remains $59.37\/BNB.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, let&#8217;s look at these publications and statements from eminent personalities featured across popular top Binance Coin news channels on the Binance Coin predictions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Trading Beasts Binance Coin Price Prediction 2021:<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-33085 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Trading-Beasts-Binance-Coin-Price-Prediction-2021.jpg\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Trading Beasts releases monthly predictions of different cryptocurrencies based on &#8220;historical data and using a combination of linear and polynomial regressions.&#8221; The platform is optimistic about Binance Coin price and has Binance Coin price predictions up until 2024.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Per the Binance Coin predictions, there won&#8217;t be a price drop throughout the year. The predictions confirm that there will be a consistent price increase for BNB price 11throughout the year. The maximum Binance coin USD increase will be at $62.862 by the end of the year. The analysis shows a +20% increase in price at the maximum Binance coin price in March. The Trading Beats group is more optimistic about the Binance coin price increase in the long run. The analysis is that the BNB price will make a maximum price increase around $60 &#8211; $69 throughout the year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The complete analysis by the group is focused on a steady price increase. In the analysis, there will never be a drop in price in a month-on-month average price.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Wallet Investor Binance Coin Price Prediction 2021:<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-33096 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Wallet-Investor-Binance-Coin-Price-Prediction-2021.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallet Invest, a crypto prediction portal, is also bullish on Binance Coin Price USD value in 2021. Wallet Investor predicts the maximum Binance Coin Price USD value to hang above $70 &#8211; $81.77 in 2021. This projection is based largely on BNB price performance over the previous years. In the previous years, the growth rate of BNB has been ending on a new price better than the previous year. Meanwhile, many of the conditions like more use cases and the recent parallel Binance chain called BSC have heavily contributed to increased Binance token price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this Binance Coin current price, such an increase will be over 10% in the Binance Coin value now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>The Cryptoground Binance Coin Price Prediction Report:<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-33107 pk-lazyload\"  width=\"204\"  height=\"287\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/The-Cryptoground-Binance-Coin-Price-Prediction-Report0A.jpg\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The only odd Binance Coin Price prediction is from Cryptoground.

The platform expects the minimum low at around $79.96 throughout the year, excluding this month. Simultaneously, the maximum high for the year will hang around $99.94 in February and $98.84 in September.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Binance Coin Price Prediction 2021:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The market price of Binance Coin can easily reach $200 before the year ends. There are numerous strong factors to this, and we will discuss them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many factors can drive the price up during this period. The digital asset is a big competitor to Ethereum, specifically the Binance Smart Chain. The blockchain technology of the digital coin is a direct upgrade of what Ethereum currently serves. The full potential is yet to be fully reached in terms of a price considering the current price of its competitor Ethereum. Currently, the Binance Smart Chain is already eating up the big volume on Ethereum transaction count.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In correlation to its counterpart Ethereum, there is a huge potential for a price increase in the future. The price now it&#8217;s still under-valued because it now serves as the best alternative to the dilemma faced by Ethereum network users and developers. The dilemma of gas fees and periodic network congestion. However, the price is gauging to stop at around $100 before the year ends.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another top competitive advantage is its user-friendly and the security it offers. The network runs a Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus mechanism. This allows the network to easily freeze funds, protecting the network from rug pull projects looking to spam the ecosystem with scam projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Binance Coin price prediction 2025:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ethereum Blockchain first spearheaded the Defi adoption. Binance Smart Chain was launched last year during the Defi frenzy to compete with the Ethereum blockchain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The BSC ecosystem is EVM compatible, making it Ethereum developers easier to build on the Binance smart chain. Many more projects now have ported through to Binance smart chain to bring low fees to its users while offering the same services it offers to its users on the Ethereum blockchain to BSC now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the long run, Binance Coin Price will be at a value near that of Ethereum currently. BNB Price at $1000 is possible by 2025 if the Defi adoption grows bigger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Binance Coin (BNB) Price Prediction Verdict:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a final verdict for the Binance Coin price prediction is impossible due to the uncertainties in the market. Binance coin is currently among ten cryptocurrencies, according to Coinmarketcap data. Binance coin is the best performing exchange token in the crypto market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being the best alternative to Ethereum places a good validation on Binance coin in the long run. Binance Smart Chain offers smart contract services alongside every other use case deployable on the Ethereum network. It offers even more with its parallel chain Binance Chain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Advantages and benefits are abounding here. For investors on Ethereum, there is usually a loss of funds that are most times unrecoverable.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Funds recovery on Ethereum is usually impossible. But the PoA consensus mechanism of the Binance Smart Chain makes funds recovery possible to some extent. This boosts investors&#8217; confidence and adds some credibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These factors post some kind of verdict to investors on the potentials of the cryptocurrency in the future.
