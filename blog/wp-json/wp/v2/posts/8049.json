Though, what sets them apart is that ZCash provides anonymity with transactions; and this also makes it a favorite bid for investors. Visualizing the ZCash&#8217;s past and present performances it makes to have an exceptional hope for building a better future. ZCash has astonishingly shown a very fast bump-up from the time of its launch, but will it be able to cope up with the same pace in the future? Let&#8217;s have a look at what the market has to say about ZCash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"trading-beasts-100-by-the-end-of-2020\">Trading Beasts \u2013 $100 by the end of 2020<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Trading Beast is a great online resource to get tutorials on crypto and crypto trading. It is quite sure about ZCash estimating up to $146.24 by the end of 2019. Then, they expect, ZEC will have ups and downs, eventually reaching $100 by the end of 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"bein-crypto-more-than-380-by-the-beginning-of-2020\">Bein Crypto \u2013 more than $380 by the beginning of 2020<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bein crypto, the prominent crypto newsmaker, shows the quite clear point on ZCash price in the next year. It determines the ZEC price to rise to $380 by the end of 2019, and even more in the first quarter of 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"coinswitch-867-usd-by-the-end-of-2020\">CoinSwitch \u2013 $867 USD by the end of 2020<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Coinswitch has analyzed ZCash and proceeded with the verdict that the coin is quite stable with high potentials to rise in the future. They forecasted ZCash to cross $500 mark by the end of 2019. Next year, CoinSwitch is confident that ZEC will get eight times higher than the current price, and will hit the $867 mark by the end of 2020.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"walletinvestor-56-994\">WalletInvestor \u2013 $56.994<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WalletInvestor, a financial hub that has the most actual information on Forex, Stock, and cryptocurrency charts, and a market cap assumes that ZEC is a bad short-term investment (1 year or less).

Only in 6 years, the price can drastically change and get up to $284.968.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"grayscale-investments-500-and-more\">Grayscale Investments \u2013 $500 and more<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another online resource giving investment expertise predicts ZEC to reach as high as $500 USD by the end of 2019.

Right after leading Bitcoin, there are hundreds of new cryptocurrencies competing with each other in the crypto market. Still, besides all, they have one thing in common, which is their unpredictable nature of growth. It always depends on various points, influencing the market as a whole. To understand what can affect the ZEC price, we should consider some considerations about the ZCash future.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plans on collaboration with new promising projects, possibility to adopt Z-addresses (shielded transaction) on the platform unlike to T-addresses similar to BTC, the ability to increase the transactions&#8217; speed processing and capacity, a limited amount of coins, certainly make ZCash one of the fast-growing and potential platforms in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will definitely be many more updates. Still, currently, we think that ZCash can reach up to $350 by the end of 2020, and it&#8217;s almost nothing that restrains crypto players and investors from being positive about ZEC development. Let&#8217;s have a look at a few factors that could help us determine the forecast for ZCash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-zcash-zec\">What is ZCash (ZEC)?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ZCash (ZEC) is a cryptocurrency created by Zerocoin Electric Coin Company in September 2016. It is the first cryptocurrency coping the concept of blockchain technology with Zk-Snarks (proof construction or &#8216;secret key&#8217; to prove certain information on a blockchain). This, as stated in the announcement of ZCash CEO Zooko Wilcox at the launching time, is the key feature, a part of the plan to make the ZCash (ZEC) project similar to Bitcoin. However, with no snags as BTC delivers. Thanks to the implemented Zk-Snarks, users can successfully make transactions without disclosing any info about the amount they transact and what the parties involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping this idea in mind, the ZCash team gave birth to ZEC coin copying the Bitcoin technology and adding on extra features. They give semi-transparent options to the network and prevent trust issues with the high-security set-up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ZCash (ZEC) is a virtual decentralized blockchain that enables its users to manage the ZEC transactions easily, anonymously, and secure.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the technology is similar to Bitcoin, the currency has a lot in common with BTC but far more to be discovered. ZEC also has features like open-source and a hard coins&#8217; limit of 21 million. Though, in terms of maintaining compatibility and confidentiality level, the coins have a vast difference. ZCash enables to provide trailblazing cryptography use, i.e., a new way for technology development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"zcash-zec-price-chart\">ZCash (ZEC) Price Chart<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"ZCash (ZEC) Price Chart\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/5ymU8u7brUMvz5fTRHLHhV_JOb0qnGyhPxNvWsUAdyubvpgyiEhardMaRjwFKWVkdO-3xHzKDelB3YmnrDmYkye3mzUkCmHX3iS9hEk_tIaapPijf2Om4hBeE_Fy-aykGmtW8JZe\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>(ZCash price from October 2016 till the present day with ATH)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"zcash-zec-features\">ZCash (ZEC) Features<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ZCash (ZEC), like any other cryptocurrency, has a particular set of features that has to make the platform technically better. As a result, it should affect the price. Here are some core capabilities and features that play a role in ZEC growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Low-Fee Transactions that support instant coin transfer and a low-fee price for it (only 0.0001 ZEC) is a seducing feature. It makes ZCash interesting for a high amount of exchanges and top wallets. Atomic Wallet, for example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Address and Transaction Privacy provided by the ZCash platform are of two types \u2013 shielded and transparent. In the first one, addresses and transactions can be left unrevealed as well as transaction amount and indeed the encrypted memo field content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second one, transparent, transactions, and addresses are visible; they are published on the blockchain just in the same way as it&#8217;s open on the Bitcoin blockchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Encrypted memos is a content of the memo field, which is available in the shielded transactions. According to this feature, the sender is enabled to fill in the necessary information of the receiver and make it in an entirely encrypted way. This feature is prevalent if users want to exchange messages and instructions as well as establish some sort of conformity with the Bank Secrecy Act&#8217; Travel&#8217; rule.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ZCash provides multi-signature transactions demanding multiple signatures on them. It means fewer transactions may require two or more parties to confirm the transaction before funds will be available. They cannot be shielded \u2013 the transactions are transparent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Payment Disclosure is a protocol, which enables the sender or the receiver, involved in a particular transaction process, open up specific information about the transaction to the third party. It may be needed as per requirements like proof, conformity, or visibility. Any person can disclose a memo and a value of the transaction, although, with no access to the other people&#8217;s addresses. This feature, protocol, is being under consideration at the moment, but most probably will be out next year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-buy-zcash-zec-nbsp\">How to buy ZCash (ZEC)?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, Atomic wallet is known as one of the easiest, safe, and transparent options to buy, manage, and store your digital assets.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app is a universal cryptocurrency wallet that supports more than 300 cryptos with all the most famous like BTC, ETH, XRP, XLM, ZEC, and many more.
