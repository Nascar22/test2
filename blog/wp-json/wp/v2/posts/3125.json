The primary use scenario is quite simple: someone who needs a complicated technical process to be executed can lend additional resources to network participants\u2019 computers. The method may be a video or computer graphics rendering, complicated calculations, or anything else requiring high performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The native ERC20-based token of the net is called GNT. It is a utility token \u2014 the main purpose is paying fees for the computing resources rent. It can\u2019t be mined, the only way to get it is earning by sharing your computer or rigs performance with other participants\u2019 &#8211; if someone uses your hardware for their purposes, you gain GNT. Of course, there is also the way of trading: as of this writing, GNT is listed on many exchanges, including major ones: Binance, Bittrex, Huobi, and Upbit. There are trading pairs mostly with BTC, ETH, USDT, KRW, and USD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Golem technically allows implementing dApps (decentralized applications) as tools for maintaining the needs of users. Developers can use this feature to solve the compatibility issue between software that requires the computing power and blockchain environment. It\u2019s a bit, sophisticated system that is still to be simplified.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two algorithms that help in maintaining the network\u2019s functions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>System of consents \u2014 third-party verified developers who manually monitor the correctness of different operations within the blockchain. They can double-check and confirm results and manually help processes that got stuck on some level if needed. Consents earn an additional GNT fee for that work.<\/li><li>Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) \u2014 an algorithm that creates a protected area in a computer\u2019s memory for some process. This technology also provides end-to-end encryption and protects the information from any kind of fraud from the outside. In other words, SGX is the thing that makes sure that someone will not compromise the data you process with their computers.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The company behind the project is called Golem Factory \u2014 a Switzerland-based IT-team. They released the ICO token sale in November 2016.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"golem-wallet\">Golem Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your crypto wisely!
