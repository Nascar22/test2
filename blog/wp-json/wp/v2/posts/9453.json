All the Best Cryptocurrencies are <em>decentralized<\/em>. They are not issued by a central authority, like a bank or a government.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cryptocurrencies are based on <em>blockchain technology <\/em>\u2013 a network of computers completely independent from centralized control who keep a track record of all the transactions of the past and those that will be carried out in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investing in cryptocurrencies is becoming more and more popular every year. It is a global investment opportunity available to anyone in any part of the world. They are a highly profitable instrument, very volatile and they bear a certain risk factor.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cryptocurrencies are becoming an acceptable means of payment worldwide. Blockchain technology is reliable, it cannot be counterfeited, manipulated or changed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No other technology makes it possible to send money from one part of the world to the other without an intermediary to carry out the transaction. It is the most affordable means to send money from point A to point B known today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are in full control of your money! No questions are asked. All you need is a computer or a mobile phone and you can transact with whoever you want when you want it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speed is what makes cryptocurrencies different from traditional banking. While a bank transfer can sometimes take up to 2-3 days, a cryptocurrency transaction is settled in a few minutes. Some are confirmed within seconds but more about that later.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what else makes cryptocurrencies so valuable? Their supply is limited. A Maximum supply means the maximum amount of coins that will ever exist for a certain cryptocurrency.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us think about this for a moment. How is the paper money we use every day created? It is simple. It gets printed by Central Banks and governments when they need it! Bitcoin doesn\u2019t work that way. You cannot press a button and create more Bitcoins or add new sheets of paper to the printing press. Cryptocurrencies are scarce. The smaller the amount of an important asset there is in existence the more valuable it becomes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies are created by a method known as <em>mining<\/em>. Mining refers to solving complex math problems that produce new bitcoin. More information about mining is available here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-much-to-invest-in-cryptocurrencies\">How Much to Invest in Cryptocurrencies?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone who has access to a computer or a mobile phone can invest in cryptocurrencies. Everyone can afford them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on your budget and your goals you can invest as little as $1 or several $1000. There are no limitations to what you can do. The only limitations can be set by the exchange on which you are buying your cryptocurrencies. Especially to young people, cryptocurrencies are seen as the fastest way to obtain wealth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always remember to invest only what you can afford to lose and diversify your portfolio. \u201c<em>Don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket\u201d.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology are still at its early stages and these assets will dominate the market in a few years. Our generation has been given a chance to invest in the future of the Internet. 30 years ago, during the .com era, many of us didn\u2019t have a chance to participate. Will we make the right decision now?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"top-cryptocurrencies-to-buy-in-2020\">Top Cryptocurrencies to Buy in 2020<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>#1 Bitcoin<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin is the first and the world\u2019s biggest and most popular cryptocurrency on the market. It was created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, an anonymous software developer whose identity has not been revealed to this day.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He had a vision of an independent payment method that could be transferred without using banks. A crypto portfolio without Bitcoin is hard to think of.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several reasons why Bitcoin has always been considered as a reasonable investment. Bitcoin is decentralized \u2013 there is no central institution controlling the supply of Bitcoin.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Bitcoin price\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/TJSUmawFjTcxZRfEW_uepfoe7Bf1RnB7mVF33UYh8awSE8kQWp9BfM7Ez8KMBklw_-7s9XlfrV1_Bn9It_U69wmaY9A_y0Cr1dSW4XVHSf6132n_pyDTra35VnXokyxXmPbHcZ4\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The supply of Bitcoin is limited. Fiat currencies can be printed whenever they are needed and they are unlimited in supply. Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million Bitcoins and over 18 million has already been mined.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin transactions are anonymous. Since Bitcoin is not governed by a central entity, users don\u2019t have to identify themselves to be able to transact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Irreversibility. Once confirmed, Bitcoin transactions can\u2019t be reversed, changed or deleted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The story of one investor who paid 10,000 Bitcoins for a pizza in 2010 is well known in crypto circles. An investment that would have been worth over $80 million today.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>May 22 is celebrated as the yearly Bitcoin Pizza Day to remember the day when Laszlo Hanyecz spent 10,000 Bitcoins on pizza.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What does 2020 hold for Bitcoin? Bitcoin is still the best and safest cryptocurrency investment. The entire crypto market moves in parallel with Bitcoin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May 2020 an important event will take place known as <em>Bitcoin Halving.<\/em> A halving happens once every 4 years (every 210,000 blocks). It is expected that this event will boost Bitcoin&#8217;s price by 10x or more like it did in the past.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the day of the &#8216;halving&#8217;, the block reward will be reduced from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC per block. In 2012 was the first halving. One year after the event the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed from $11 to $1,100$. After the second halving, the price of Bitcoin rose from $700 to over $20,000 at the end of 2017.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Bitcoin Marketplace.\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/F6Jk1izBUbCWqvyioKZyMmt3zUXmRTyFtEOtN0VBpA2Rh6bnrgIIavZWmG7aklbwUZON5UzSNgZx3IAWJ84wN7xbdhIs9kFhOSXFjBeIW6nVlbuK0M0N5HriAi4c-fBAEeUZgKM\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What can we expect after the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> halving?
