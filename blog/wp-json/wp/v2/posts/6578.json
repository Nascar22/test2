The exchange claims it\u2019s unlikely that ICON (ICX) coin price will exceed $1 level in the middle-term perspective as the cryptocurrency market is still far from starting the recovery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"mineable-icon-icx-price-prediction\">Mineable ICON (ICX) Price Prediction<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cryptocurrency-focused YouTube channel Mineable listed ICX in Top-5 altcoins to keep an eye on. \u201cICON has tremendous potential in achieving wide adoption in the country and beyond.\u201d The channel claims the project may be the only one in the industry that\u2019s already getting substantial revenue coming in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"pantera-capital-icon-icx-price-prediction\">Pantera Capital ICON (ICX) Price Prediction<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The very first U.S. Bitcoin investment firm Pantera Capital is pretty hyped on the ICON project. The firm participated in the ICO in 2017 and in July 2019, it\u2019s even hiddenly invested approximately $1 billion USD in ICX.
