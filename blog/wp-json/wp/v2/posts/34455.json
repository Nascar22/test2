He was a former programmer at Amazon. Joe Kwon worked with Ethan Buchman to build the Cosmos (Atom). Ethan Buchman aims to provide the community with various options for engaging in consensus-building across a wide range of industries. At the same time, Jae Kwon is the creator of the Tendermint protocol. He is passionate about promoting the Tendermint consensus algorithm, which he positions as the most efficient consensus algorithm that seeks maximum speed and scalability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together they created Tendermint in 2017, which was created to replace proof-of-work as the consensus algorithm for blockchains, which eventually turned into a company, birthing Cosmos(Atom), in march 2019, an initial coin offering (ICO). They managed to raise $17 million in less than 30 minutes of the ICO, and one ATOM was sold for $0.1<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cosmos (Atom) goal is to create an &#8216;internet of blockchains&#8217; that resolves both scalability and interoperability issues in the blockchain. The Cosmos network can interact with other cryptocurrencies and applications, which other blockchain networks cannot achieve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"nbsp-cosmos-atom-coin-price-chart\"><strong>&nbsp;Cosmos (Atom) Coin Price Chart:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1520\"  height=\"720\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-34456 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 1520px) 100vw, 1520px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/dev.atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Price-chart-from-trading-view0A.jpg\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Price-chart-from-trading-view0A.jpg 1520w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Price-chart-from-trading-view0A-1024x485.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Price-chart-from-trading-view0A-300x142.jpg 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Price-chart-from-trading-view0A-768x364.jpg 768w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Price-chart-from-trading-view0A-380x180.jpg 380w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Price-chart-from-trading-view0A-800x379.jpg 800w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Price-chart-from-trading-view0A-1160x549.jpg 1160w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Price chart from trading view<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cosmos (ATOM) is significantly new on the market, so many people still may not understand too much about it. It poses a complex cryptocurrency project to comprehend. Still, a vital thing to remember is that Cosmos essentially solves the scalability and interoperability problems that blockchains face today as it sits amongst the top-ranked projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the listing in march 2019, the Cosmos price USD started trading on exchanges with a price of $3.40 and quickly reached $5. The cryptocurrency went on to surge from April through to June as it rocketed by a total of 132% to reach the then ATH price of around $7.23 in June 2019. However, after reaching this level of resistance, ATOM rolled over and dropped by a significant 72% as it plummeted into support found in September at $1.95.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many expected the price after listing at $0.4 \u2013 $0.5. However, at the peak, the cost reached $8 (80x of the ICO price). In May 2019, the Cosmos coin was added by TrustWallet. This action immediately caused the rise of the rate to $5.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cosmos quickly reached an all-time high of $25.15 11 days ago. Cosmos is trading on 82 exchanges, with the top exchanges being Bitforex ($458.62M), Binance ($249.61M), and ZG.com ($233.91M). Cosmos had an all-time high of $25.15 11 days ago. Over the last day, Cosmos coin price did 13% increase in trading volume and had been trading on 205 active markets with its highest volume trading pairs being USDT ($1.47B), USD ($569.26M), and BTC ($236.46M).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"633\"  height=\"567\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-34457 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/dev.atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/current-price.jpg\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/current-price.jpg 633w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/current-price-572x512.jpg 572w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/current-price-226x202.jpg 226w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/current-price-380x340.jpg 380w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The ATOM coin is presently priced at $17.83.
