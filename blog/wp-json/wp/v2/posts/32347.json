One of the core aims for this innovation is to increase&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/blockchain-interoperability\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">interoperability<\/a>&nbsp;between private and public blockchain networks. With companies and corporate firms adopting blockchain technology, especially private blockchain, a blockchain&#8217;s ability to communicate with another blockchain would improve efficiency. NEM enables interoperability between these blockchains in various ways, allowing easy transfer of any digital asset, including tokens, contracts, or files between them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"mission-and-vision-of-nem\"><strong>Mission and vision of NEM<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/nem-wallet\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NEM<\/a>&nbsp;exists to ensure that the NEM ecosystem is a significant contributor to blockchain&#8217;s next evolution by providing mainstream adoption and use of NEM&#8217;s blockchain solutions. This can only be achieved through a robust and healthy ecosystem that works together through collaboration, transparency, and openness. NEM shapes blockchain&#8217;s future by nurturing a healthy and robust ecosystem that will contribute to blockchain technology for generations to come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>NEM aims to create and sustain a viable and robust ecosystem that connects and benefits individuals, developers, businesses, and society.

By March 2015, a&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/bitcoin-forks-history\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fork<\/a>&nbsp;of NXT was created. This fork was managed by a non-profit organization based in Singapore called&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/nem.io\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NEM Foundation<\/a>, which decided to develop its code-base for more scalability and usability. Then came the &#8216;New Economic Movement.&#8217; The NEM Group, currently led by Chief Executive Officer David Shaw and Chief Financial Officer Iain Wilson, also Managing Director of NEM Trading, has since focused on increasing NEM adoption through brand awareness, strategic marketing, and training and core partnerships. The NEM team comprises Eight(8) core members who work towards the goal of the project.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, NEM was selected by the Ukraine Central Election Commission for a&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/a-ukrainian-election-official-is-trialing-nems-blockchain-for-voting\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pilot program<\/a>&nbsp;to test the feasibility of blockchain-based voting systems.

Proof-of-importance is a blockchain consensus algorithm first introduced by NEM to determine which network participants or nodes are eligible to add a block to the blockchain, in a process that is known as &#8216;harvesting.&#8217; Proof-of-importance is a novel blockchain consensus algorithm that measures one&#8217;s overall support for the NEM network, rewarding eligible individuals accordingly. Eligibility for importance on the network is measured in 3 categories:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Vesting (minimum of 10,000XEM held in an account for a particular duration)<\/li><li>Transaction partners on the network.<\/li><li>Number\/ Size of transactions in the last 30days.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The Harvesting approach works differently compared to&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/blockchain-proof-of-work\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Proof-of-work<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/p\/proof-stake-pos.asp#:~:text=Proof%20of%20Stake%20(PoS)%20concept,power%20he%20or%20she%20has.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Proof-of-stake<\/a>&nbsp;consensus algorithms.

They are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NEM NIS1<\/strong>:This is the blockchain platform for NEM functioning to provide flexible and customizable solutions via very easy-to-use built-in features. NEM NIS1 has had zero downtime, chain hacks, or significant outages since its creation. NIS1 is built for high performance and&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/blockchain-scalability-problem-and-solution\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">scalability<\/a>, and modular customization of any application, with its two-tier security architecture, involves Eigentrust++ and NEM node network for high-level security. With its Plug-and-Play architecture, NEM NIS1 provides the perfect blockchain tool to build your project.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Proof-of-importance consensus protocol in the NEM NIS1 would be replaced by a Modified Proof-of-stake protocol in the Symbol blockchain when it launches in February 2021. The technology stack between NIS1 and Symbol blockchain is not compatible; hence, the Symbol blockchain will be introduced simultaneously with NIS1. An opt-in process will determine the token allocation of the XYM tokens (the native token of the new Symbol blockchain).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Symbol blockchain from NEM<\/strong>: Symbol is a trusted, secure value exchange network that powers possibilities and connects businesses with blockchain. Aimed to increase the flow of data and innovation to supercharge the creation, exchange, and protection of assets, Symbol is the ecosystem that connects businesses, developers, and individuals and enables countless possibilities for blockchain. Launching in February 2021, Symbol, the core technology powering the NEM ecosystem alongside the NEM Group, NEM Ventures, and NEM Trading would bring social, commercial, and technical excellence to NEM blockchain. Features of the Symbol blockchain include:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Increased security is a contract plug-in framework that makes Symbol more resistant to human error and network attacks.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Enhanced interoperability to enable Symbol to communicate between blockchains seamlessly.

In December 2020, the code for Symbol blockchain was announced to have been &#8220;frozen&#8221; in its current iteration, as the final steps were being made towards the main net launch. The NEM developer team has been building Symbol and its &#8220;unique&#8221; hybrid public and private architecture for years and hope to have a smooth and successful main net launch.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;Created for enterprise use, Symbol is purpose-built to be flexible to a suite of use cases, spanning regulated markets, supply chain, fintech, healthcare, government and more&#8221;.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>said Dave Hodgson, CIO of NEM Group. A symbol will launch version 1.0 of its blockchain on January 14th, 2021 and will be available for use by token holders, businesses and others. According to Kristy-Leigh Minehan, CTO of NEM Software,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<em>&#8220;As a hybrid network, Symbol offers a best of both world&#8217;s scenario and more flexibility to businesses in how they manage and share data&#8221;&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Symbol&#8217;s hybrid technology means businesses can not only benefit from the transparency brought by Symbol to the public blockchain but also allow data security, data protection, data restrictions and encryption measures to protect businesses&#8217; confidential information and foster interoperability and communication between different blockchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In February 2021, NEM would launch the Symbol public blockchain, where XEM token holders would opt-in to receive free XYM in a 1:1 ratio. Opt-in for this Airdrop ends in January of 2021 (dependent on the outcome of POI community vote), while the snapshot for the airdrop will take place at approximately 10 pm AEDT on January 14th, 2021.
