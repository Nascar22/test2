Created in 2017 as a token,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/binance-coin-wallet\">BNB coin<\/a>&nbsp;was based on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/ethereum-wallet\">Ethereum blockchain<\/a>&nbsp;as an&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/coins-and-tokens\">ERC-20 token<\/a>. Then Binance announced moving to its own blockchain called Binance Chain. This news has attracted the interest of even more investors than before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-bnb\">What is BNB<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>BNB is a tradable asset, its total amount is 200 MLN, ~1,600,000BNB tokens will be burned by Binance to make the remaining coins even more valuable. Once the testnet is verified for efficiency, Binance will begin a token swap that is predicted to take place in March 2019.Binance DEX will be launched on the Binance Chain, users will have to use BNB as a fee for transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/d3MMyApsVs3Vpuvu\/giphy.gif\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After launching the Binance Chain, there will be burned as many BNB coins as BNB tokens have already been burned before on the Ethereum Network and this process will continue. All BNB users will need to transfer their tokens to the Binance Chain to maintain their BNB token balance. To manage Binance Coin you may use&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\">Atomic Wallet<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be no mining on the Binance Chain. Binance \u0441hain uses a BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerant) and PoS (Proof-of-Stake) consensus. This is similar to some popular blockchain systems, such as&nbsp;EOS or NEO.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the&nbsp;Binance Chain&nbsp;you can:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Send and receive assets<\/li><li>Release your own token<\/li><li>Burn \/ mint and freeze tokens<\/li><li>Create trading pairs on Binance DEX and trade assets<\/li><li>And most importantly, on the Binance Chain basis will be created a new cryptocurrency decentralized exchange \u2013 Binance DEX.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"dex\"><span id=\"what-is-decentralized-exchange-dex\">What is Decentralized exchange (DEX)<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Decentralized Exchange (DEX) is a new type of the cryptocurrency exchange, in which traders own their private keys and control their funds. This solves a problem such as the fact that centralized exchanges store private keys in their bases and as the saying goes: Not your keys \u2013 not your Bitcoin.<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/officialmcafee\/status\/1041033681312403456\n\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201cDecentralized exchanges, when fully functional, will mark the end of any potential control by governments and will be the beginning of the largest economic boom in human history\u201d.<\/a>&nbsp;&#8211; John MacAfee<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"binance-dex\"><span id=\"what-is-binance-dex\">What is Binance DEX<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Binance DEX based on the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) protocol and allows users to exchange crypto assets directly between each other. The main advantage of Binance DEX is the matching system. Binance DEX is created on a high powerful blockchain engine &#8220;Tendermint Core&#8221; with one-second block times, that provides the speed, which is also the same to centralized exchanges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1620\"  height=\"1080\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-14729 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 1620px) 100vw, 1620px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/binance-ceo-1620x1080.jpg\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/binance-ceo-1620x1080.jpg 1620w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/binance-ceo-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/binance-ceo-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/binance-ceo-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/binance-ceo.jpg 2000w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWith the core Binance Chain technology, Binance DEX can handle the same trading volume as Binance.com is handling today. This solves the issues many other decentralized exchanges face with speed and power&#8221;.<br>\u2014 CZ, CEO Binance<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"works\"><span id=\"how-the-binance-dex-works\">How the Binance DEX works<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The difference is that the centralized exchange constantly matches orders, and in the Binance DEX all orders will be executed at the same time when it is added to the block.<br>If the order is not completed within 72 hours, it will be canceled. Here is what Binance post about Order Matches details:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2014 Orders with best bid price would match with an order with best ask price; \u2014 If the orders on one price cannot be fully filled by the opposite orders: for the orders with the same price, the orders from the earlier blocks would be selected and filled first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2014 If the orders have the same price and block height, and cannot be fully filled, the execution would be allocated to each order in proportion to their quantity (floored if the number has a partial lot). If the allocation cannot be accurately divided, a deterministic algo would guarantee that no consistent bias to any orders: according to a sorted sequence of a de facto random order ID\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"the-binance-dex-binance-chain-overview\">The Binance DEX \/ Binance Chain Overview<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the fact that the idea of a decentralized exchange has already been implemented, and there is already exists an exchange with a decentralized order book, such as Waves Platform, for example, the Binance DEX is looking like one of the first mass-adopted solutions in the DEX area. In conclusion, here are the main advantages of Binance DEX:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Private keys under user\u2019s control<\/li><li>Decentralized order book<\/li><li>Matching with one-second block time<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The combination of these three factors can really take the cryptocurrency market to the new level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-14741 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/binance_coin_wallet.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To get your own BNB address on the Binance Chain download a non-custodial Atomic Wallet that supports 300+ cryptocurrency assets, built-in exchange and \u201cBuy crypto with a credit card\u201d service.
