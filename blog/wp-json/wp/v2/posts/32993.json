This cryptocurrency has a number 10 ranking on CoinMarketCap. Launched in 2017, Bitcoin Cash is the first of all altcoins that are forks of&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/bitcoin-explained\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bitcoin<\/a>. So what&#8217;s are your thoughts on Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2021. Over the years, more and more Bitcoin transactions were happening per second. As a result, transactions became slower since a block size of BTC is 1MB. There came to be a need for bigger block sizes and a faster transaction process. Thus, developers proposed the block size of Bitcoin Cash to be between 8MB and 32MB. Thereby processing more transactions per block and improving the network&#8217;s scalability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In August 2017, developers launched the very first Bitcoin Cash software implementation. Roger Ver stated that this new cryptocurrency would help BTC fulfill its purpose and serve as a payment service. Roger Ver is an early Bitcoin investor and a Bitcoin Cash enthusiast. Back in 2018, there was a<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/bitcoin-cash-hardfork\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&nbsp;Bitcoin Cash fork<\/a>. This fork split BCH into Bitcoin Cash ABC (Bitcoin Cash Now) and Bitcoin Cash SV (Satoshi Vision). This fork was due to a disagreement on using smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain to increase the average block size.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"bitcoin-cash-price-chart\"><strong>Bitcoin Cash Price Chart<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Bitcoin Cash chart\"  class=\"wp-image-32994 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Bitcoin-Cash-Price-Chart0A.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"market-prediction-for-bitcoin-cash-bch-price-2021\"><strong>Market Prediction for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price 2021<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During this write-up, BCH&#8217;s price is above USD 500 with a market capitalization of $9,392,404,900. Bitcoin Cash has a gold-like market supply. Its market supply is limited, just like that of&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/bitcoin-explained\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bitcoin<\/a>. Currently, its circulating supply is 18,649,950 BCH, with a maximum supply of 21,000,000 BCH coins. Thus, 89% of Bitcoin Cash has been mined. Meanwhile, BCH is currently listed on over one-hundred cryptocurrency exchanges, majorly in USDT, USD, and BTC pairs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the investment angle, Bitcoin Cash&#8217;s current price is very likely to keep moving up. 33% of investors are large holders, and over 90% of BCH holders are holding long-term. Long-term holders and large investors create bullish moves. Thus, Bitcoin Cash predictions suggest a spike in the coming months of 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"bitcoin-cash-predictions-for-2021\"><strong>Bitcoin Cash Predictions for 2021<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin Cash&#8217;s current price has gone beyond expectations, and it continues to surge.

Accordingly, by the end of 2025, DigitalCoinPrice expects BCH price to be over&nbsp;<strong>$1,400<\/strong>. They also provide Bitcoin Cash prediction up till 2028. DigitalCoinPrice is affirmative on the fact that Bitcoin cash will increase in the future. Furthermore, in 7 years, they predict that we will have BCH over&nbsp;<strong>$2,000<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"wallet-investor-bitcoin-cash-price-prediction-2021\"><strong>Wallet Investor Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2021<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Wallet Investor Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2021\"  class=\"wp-image-33016 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Wallet-Investor-Bitcoin-Cash-Price-Prediction-20210A.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Wallet Investor, BCH might be a lousy long-term or 1-year investment. Their prediction stands around&nbsp;<strong>$420 per Bitcoin Cash<\/strong>&nbsp;at the end of 2021. Wallet Investor says from their technical analysis; Bitcoin Cash might be a long-term foul play for investors. Wallet Investor also stresses that although Bitcoin Cash will not hit $1,000 in a year, BCH can never crash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"tradingbeasts-bitcoin-cash-price-prediction-2021\"><strong>TradingBeasts Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2021<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"TradingBeasts Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2021\"  class=\"wp-image-33027 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/TradingBeasts-Bitcoin-Cash-Price-Prediction-20210A.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>TradingBeasts, however, forecasts a bullish play for long-term holders of Bitcoin Cash. Their Bitcoin Cash price prediction stands at&nbsp;<strong>$574 per BCH<\/strong>. While TradingBeasts&#8217; projection depicts monthly retracements and average highs and lows, BCH will close at over&nbsp;<strong>$500<\/strong>&nbsp;by December 2021, according to TradingBeasts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"long-forecast-bitcoin-cash-price-prediction-2021\"><strong>Long Forecast Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2021<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Long Forecast Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2021\"  class=\"wp-image-33038 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Long-Forecast-Bitcoin-Cash-Price-Prediction-20210A.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Longforecast seems to have a bullish prediction for BCH price. According to their analysis, BCH will close at over $1,000 by July but will dump to over $800 by December. Although this forecast still depicts a bullish close for the year, it might cause a bearish move in 2022. Even though this is just a forecast, the analysis might play out, and it&#8217;s just a matter of time for us to find out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"roger-ver-bitcoin-cash-coin-price-prediction\"><strong>Roger Ver Bitcoin Cash Coin Price prediction<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Roger Ver Bitcoin Cash Coin Price prediction\"  class=\"wp-image-33049 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Roger-Ver-Bitcoin-Cash-Coin-Price-prediction0A.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin early investor Roger Ver is an optimist of Bitcoin Cash. The Bitcoin Cash enthusiast tweeted earlier in January that when Bitcoin Cash hits $500, it will be like when Bitcoin hit $50. Ver says the financial market worldwide is ten times bigger than the gold market. Thus, prices of assets like BCH will always skyrocket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few days after the previous tweet, Ver tweeted about Bitcoin Cash again. He said that while Bitcoin may replace Gold, Bitcoin Cash may replace fiat currencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Roger Ver Bitcoin Cash Coin Price prediction\"  class=\"wp-image-33060 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Roger-Ver-Bitcoin-Cash-Coin-Price-prediction0A-2.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Roger Ver does not give a specific Bitcoin Cash price prediction, his tweets suggest massive bullish moves for BCH.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"bitcoin-cash-price-prediction-2021\"><strong>Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2021<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2020, Bitcoin Cash had about 60% annual price gain. Meanwhile, since January 4, 2021, BCH&#8217;s price has not gone below&nbsp;<strong>$400<\/strong>. One thing that might affect Bitcoin Cash coin price is the recent hard fork. Remember, the split was due to low trust among crypto and Bitcoin developers and communities. Some Bitcoin Cash protocols sways away from Bitcoin&#8217;s original philosophy, hence the hard fork. Since BCH now has rivals, some market forces might push its price downwards in the long run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, none of that might affect Bitcoin Cash. As Bitcoin Cash news suggests, BCH brought better scalability than the Bitcoin blockchain. Transactions are not as slow as predicted, and payment fees are low. Bitcoin Cash continues to gain popularity. It is listed on most of the top-rated exchanges, including Coinbase. Also, some services are beginning to accept Bitcoin Cash as a payment method. Even South Africans can pay for legal services with Bitcoin Cash. Hence, more investors might buy into Bitcoin Cash soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"bitcoin-cash-price-prediction-2025\"><strong>Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2025<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many predictions available for Bitcoin Cash 2025 price are analyzed based on the current BCH price. Not many investors and crypto enthusiasts have given such a long-term forecast for Bitcoin Cash. Meanwhile, Roger Ver gave his long-term speculation for Bitcoin Cash, saying it might replace fiat currencies. Of course, that is not happening too soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judging by the&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/bitcoin-explained\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bitcoin<\/a>&nbsp;perspective, Bitcoin Cash coin price is expected to be in the thousand-dollar figure by 2025 because Bitcoin itself should be worth some six-figures by 2025. Roger Ver likewise made this claim when he said Bitcoin Cash value at $500 would be equal to BTC at $50.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"bitcoin-cash-price-prediction-verdict\"><strong>Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction Verdict<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the current bull run or alt season the crypto market is experiencing, Bitcoin Cash is not left out. Bitcoin Cash price USD has gone from $400 since January to over $500, the Bitcoin Cash current price range. On January 11, Bitcoin Cash price USD went above $600. That is about a 40% increase in 2021 alone, and the price continues to increase. Also, a very high percent of Bitcoin Cash holders are long-term investors; thus, a good chunk of the asset is not in circulation. So, considering market instabilities, Bitcoin Cash price USD might reach an&nbsp;<strong>$800<\/strong>&nbsp;price mark and beyond in 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, more than 18 million out of the overall 21 million Bitcoin Cash value supply have been bought. Thus, the supply continues to decrease. As Bitcoin Cash news spreads, the media will also begin to publicize BCH for everyone. With a declining pool and a possible hype in Bitcoin Cash news, Bitcoin Cash value might eventually surge. Thus, Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency worthy of buying in 2021. Just as Bitcoin had ups and downs, Bitcoin Cash coin price, too, might have the same fluctuations. However, the coin will be a good play out in the long run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investors and those who decide to buy Bitcoin Cash (BCH) can do so on Atomic Wallet.

Although it dumped to retest at a low price, Litecoin stood on its feet again in 2020. Meanwhile, its price is still very much below that all-time-high. Currently, LTC has seen about a 30% increase in 2021. After setting its first higher high after a higher low, Litecoin might be looking at an uptrend market. Also, Litecoin Foundation has been pushing the project by sponsoring brands. NFL and UFC are examples of these sports brands. Media awareness can create an increase in demand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, putting all these together, Litecoin seems to be a good coin to buy in 2021.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction in 2021.
