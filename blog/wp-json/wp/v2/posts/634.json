As a result, the problem can be solved if, for example, you lost access to the electronic accounts or made an error during the money transfer.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any cryptocurrency is nothing more than a collection of transaction entries in electronic form. Accordingly, a cryptocurrency wallet contains only two keys:&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>public, which is essentially the address of the wallet and can be shared to receive transfers from other users;<\/li><li>private, which is used as a means of access to receive cryptocurrency and must be secured.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"safety\"><span id=\"cryptocurrency-wallet-is-a-serious-thing\">Cryptocurrency wallet is a serious thing!<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The safety of funds depends entirely on its owner (this situation is a consequence of some of the minuses of most recent digital money).<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/OsmvssRqPCZkZERPzLF5YwCdThad66IEZeT0EmOV-11MpuUhddIvb1taRv00JdyqSSDzNhHx8hq5G01sGfzQKcuDmoyQ6c94UuR_DbiGZ47AOf1seVbqQoxdXWd5EDNH5stUAi_E\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Key loss or errors during transactions leads to a complete and irrevocable deprivation of all the money in a cryptocurrency wallet.

Moreover, it&#8217;s impossible to prove the fact of fraud because the platforms of most of the cryptocurrencies are built based on pseudonymity (wallet addresses and sums of money are in the public domain, but it&#8217;s mostly impossible to associate a cryptocurrency wallet with the name of a specific person). However, such a situation may change in the future.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\"><span id=\"how-does-cryptocurrency-wallet-work\">How Does Cryptocurrency Wallet Work?<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"719\"  height=\"250\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"how cryptocurrency wallet works\"  class=\"wp-image-637 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/cryptocurrency_wallet_1_720.png\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/cryptocurrency_wallet_1_720.png 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/cryptocurrency_wallet_1_720.png 1024w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/cryptocurrency_wallet_1_720.png 719w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/cryptocurrency_wallet_1_720.png 1920w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/cryptocurrency_wallet_1_720.png 1536w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/cryptocurrency_wallet_1_720.png 2048w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/cryptocurrency_wallet_1_720.png 380w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about this in detail:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>At the first activation, the wallet program creates an account, connects to the blockchain network and generates a set of words (Private key). So, it helps to encrypt and decrypt the data. A file with a list of these words is stored on your device. If you uninstall the application or something happens with your device, you won&#8217;t be able to access coins. To protect yourself, just remember the list of words (Private key) or print it on paper.<\/li><li>You can see your balance when the wallet is connected to block explorers. When the connection with the block explorer is established, the wallet requests all balances for all coins. It also shows any available errors. What is block explorer? It can be compared with a transaction database that contains the entire history of the blockchain.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"types\"><span id=\"cryptocurrency-wallet-types\">Cryptocurrency Wallet Types<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"719\"  height=\"250\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"cryptocurrency wallet types\"  class=\"wp-image-638 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/cryptocurrency_wallet_types.png\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/cryptocurrency_wallet_types.png 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/cryptocurrency_wallet_types.png 1024w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/cryptocurrency_wallet_types.png 719w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/cryptocurrency_wallet_types.png 1920w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/cryptocurrency_wallet_types.png 1536w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/cryptocurrency_wallet_types.png 2048w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/cryptocurrency_wallet_types.png 380w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since there are a lot of different cryptocurrency wallets, let&#8217;s try to classify them and outline the main characteristics inherent in a particular type. This will help to understand their advantages and disadvantages, which will give an impetus to make the right choice.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"cold-wallet\">Cold Wallet<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This type of storage keeps cryptocurrencies without an internet connection. Since the private key is stored directly with the wallet owner without the involvement of third parties, this method is considered the most secure.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cold wallets include computer programs that contain the entire history of transactions in the blockchain. But you need to be prepared that for this you will be required up to 200 GB of computer memory and such software may load for several days. However, it must be understood that with computer loss or breakdown, all your savings can go into oblivion.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"hardware\">Hardware<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This type of cryptocurrency wallet is one of the most reliable and can help you to securely save digital coins. It resembles the usual \u201cflash drive\u201d.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to use such a wallet, you must connect the device to a computer, laptop, tablet or smartphone. The advantage of hardware wallets is that they keep private keys separately from gadgets, which are usually constantly connected to the Internet. Even while working with the wallet, the data is safe, since all the tools work exclusively inside the device, which has its software. If the wallet is stolen from the owner, thieves won&#8217;t be able to use it, since it&#8217;s reliably protected by a PIN code.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"online-wallet\">Online Wallet<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Online cryptocurrency wallets can be accessed through any device that supports the Internet. In other words, it&#8217;s an online platform that provides services for cryptocurrency storage and movement. Online wallets keep all the data on the servers or in the user\u2019s browser cache. Private keys are held in a keystore that can be opened only with a password. The bad thing is if you clear the browser cache and haven\u2019t saved your backup, there is no way to recover access to funds including private keys, so it&#8217;s not recommended to keep too much money on them. Recently, hacker attacks on such resources have become more frequent, some of which end with success for attackers. If you have some virtual coins, then an online wallet is an ideal option that allows you to quickly make a transaction.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"desktop-wallet\">Desktop Wallet<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Desktop (computer) wallets also offer a high level of security for storing digital assets.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are divided into \u201cthick\u201d or \u201cheavy\u201d and \u201cthin\u201d. Thick ones need to be downloaded with the whole blockchain, which is constantly updated and, accordingly, takes up more and more space. Thin ones don&#8217;t \u201cask\u201d you to download the entire blockchain. When using a thin wallet, the security level of stored cryptocurrency is reduced, since all the missing information must be taken from third-party services that you have to trust.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"mobile-wallet\">Mobile Wallet<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A mobile wallet is the most suitable way to pay with cryptocurrency. It&#8217;s ideal for those who make frequent transactions throughout the day. Access to digital assets through the app provides comfortable and quick work with cryptocurrency. However, you should remember that mobile wallets cannot provide high security for funds storage, since the application client doesn&#8217;t rely on a local (downloaded to a smartphone) blockchain, but works with remote servers.<br><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"choosing\"><span id=\"what-wallet-to-choose\">What Wallet to Choose?<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"719\"  height=\"250\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"what crypto wallet to choose\"  class=\"wp-image-639 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/what-wallet-to-choose.png\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/what-wallet-to-choose.png 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/what-wallet-to-choose.png 1024w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/what-wallet-to-choose.png 719w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/what-wallet-to-choose.png 1920w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/what-wallet-to-choose.png 1536w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/what-wallet-to-choose.png 2048w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/what-wallet-to-choose.png 380w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, your choice directly depends on what specific goals you are pursuing. Following the provided above classification, the wallet&#8217;s reliability is high if it keeps cryptocurrency without an Internet connection, but such a wallet has lower variability and efficiency in money operations.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Online wallets are the least protected since the private key is located on a third-party service. However, this type of cryptocurrency storage allows you to quickly and efficiently make any transactions.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, if you plan to work with small funds and quite often make money transfers, then an online wallet is more suitable for you. If, on the contrary, you are going to accumulate a big capital, it&#8217;s better to use a portable (with storing keys on a USB flash drive) or even a hardware version.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hardware cryptocurrencies have the highest degree of protection since the private key is always located offline and doesn&#8217;t touch the global network in any case, which guarantees its inviolability on the part of third parties. But with all this, carrying out operations with cryptocurrency takes much more time.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/85ulkFCgLhQIkifwksCySuntHVE276joRXOLfkzCoyKwLyXz1PCBoD5QHQnTBAYGWXYNuyI2dSRRCCVKioStut9irexA4lJMWqc0Eo09RGut44CCLReEzh0kpqAonCAJoGWTPVZM\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But these are, so to speak, extreme cases. And sometimes you need some kind of &#8220;golden mean&#8221; when you want to ensure the optimal balance between fairly fast processing of transactions and relatively high-quality protection of electronic finance.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, it&#8217;s advisable to choose an intermediate (cold) option, which consists of installing the client program on a computer or the corresponding application on a smartphone or tablet (desktop and mobile wallets, many of which are quite reliable). This concerns the choice of a wallet according to security criteria and the speed of transactions. In this case, we recommend you to use Atomic Wallet.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"perfect-choice\"><span id=\"why-atomic-is-a-perfect-choice-to-manage-your-crypto\">Why Atomic is a Perfect Choice to Manage Your Crypto?<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"719\"  height=\"250\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"aotmic cryptocurrency wallet\"  class=\"wp-image-640 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/atomic_cryptocurrency_wallet.png\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/atomic_cryptocurrency_wallet.png 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/atomic_cryptocurrency_wallet.png 1024w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/atomic_cryptocurrency_wallet.png 719w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/atomic_cryptocurrency_wallet.png 1920w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/atomic_cryptocurrency_wallet.png 1536w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/atomic_cryptocurrency_wallet.png 2048w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/atomic_cryptocurrency_wallet.png 380w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Atomic is a decentralized multi-currency wallet that supports more than 500 cryptocurrencies and also has implemented Swap technology, which provides even more convenient and secure use.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Atomic is well-known for its simplicity, convenience, good interface, and security.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/PSy5AgyW27wBqgGyDbuJ5PUodUIueXR-1kYUSH0YMzeUC90N37W6ATEEYuPaz1Zpawvijv44f92YMm4hJXzO9m4PWT_s707cEA3oBambWIu0dc738_Z_L5oTdmA_95W15KL9Uvuh\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Security is ensured by the fact that all passwords and other data are not on any server but your device.
