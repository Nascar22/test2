On traditional exchanges, this practice is illegal and is strictly governed. However, due to the lack of cryptocurrency trading regulations in many countries, cryptomarket players are forced to develop countermeasures on their own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"info\"><span id=\"what-is-pump-and-dump\">What is pump-and-dump?<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pump&nbsp;is the market situation that leads to very fast and fundamentally unreasonable growth of a cryptocurrency rate. This usually arises from the deliberate actions of experienced traders. Most often, a successful pump is followed by a price rollback or a so-called dump.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1224\"  height=\"1080\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-10637 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 1224px) 100vw, 1224px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pump-and-dump-1224x1080.jpg\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pump-and-dump-1224x1080.jpg 1224w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pump-and-dump-300x265.jpg 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pump-and-dump-768x678.jpg 768w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pump-and-dump.jpg 1496w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dump (from English to dump or to drop)&nbsp;is the market situation completely opposite to the pump. A dump is an intentional disposition of assets in huge quantities, aimed at artificial rate lowering in the short term. The dump which is next to the pump allows manipulators to earn money from gullible traders who bought coins at an artificially high cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"main-players\">Main players<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A pump-and-dump scheme has been around for a long time. If you have watched &#8220;Boiler Room&#8221; or heard about Jordan Belfort, who became the prototype of the main character in &#8220;The Wolf of Wall Street&#8221; movie, then, most likely, you have an idea of how it works. If not, then, first of all, you should know about the main players participating in this con:&nbsp;traders-promoters&nbsp;and&nbsp;traders-investors. The first ones are well aware of the upcoming manipulation scheme, and their main goal is to attract the second ones to the game. Promoters are primarily interested in investors who don&#8217;t have much experience in trading and are more inclined to believe their \u201cexpert\u201d opinion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"896\"  height=\"448\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-10649 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pump-and-dump-in-three-steps.jpg\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pump-and-dump-in-three-steps.jpg 896w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pump-and-dump-in-three-steps-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pump-and-dump-in-three-steps-768x384.jpg 768w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mostly, a pumper is not a one person but a whole company of \u201cwell-wishers\u201d who can start buying one or another cryptocurrency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, by the way, if in poker those who can easily bring you a profit are called fish (compared to fish caught on a hook), then, in the world of digital money, flunky traders are called hamsters which are not the smartest animals, you must agree.

Large-scale pumps cannot start just like that because almost always these are well-thought-out and coordinated actions of several (tens, hundreds) people.

Sometimes, it&#8217;s not so easy to discern, is this real information or a fake. However, you can still do it with certain diligence.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"signal\"><span id=\"what-is-a-pump-signal\">What is a Pump Signal<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1000\"  height=\"634\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-10685 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pump-signal.jpg\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pump-signal.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pump-signal-300x190.jpg 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pump-signal-768x487.jpg 768w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Large-scale pumping never starts just for no reason. It&#8217;s preceded by specific signals:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Massive PR of previously unknown cryptocurrency.<\/li><li>Distribution of newsworthy events.<\/li><li>Generating hype around traders (most often selected for pumping exchanges have chats full of information about a pumped cryptocurrency).<\/li><li>An artificial increase in buying walls and so on.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Having traced these signals, an experienced trader can predict a pumping and have time to enter it with the start of the first wave (when pumpers or pumping groups begin to buy up cryptocurrency en masse).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it&#8217;s quite difficult to notice and react to these signals in time. For this, we would have to constantly monitor market schedules of many cryptocurrencies. But there are alternatives:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Subscribe to pumping groups. Even if you don&#8217;t plan to participate in a pump, you can simply track their news. Some groups report a pumping site a few days before it starts, and this information can be used for your own earnings.<\/li><li>Track cryptocurrency pumping using special monitoring services. For example, CoinData.<\/li><li>Use a special bot that tracks pumpings on the market. For example, YobitBot, CoinToolsBot, and others.<\/li><li>Create pending orders. Some exchanges (for example, Poloniex) allow you to create a pending order for a cryptocurrency sale. If you are expecting of pumping, try placing short orders at a price several times higher than now. For example, if the current value of a cryptocurrency is $ 5, set a short order for $ 20 or $ 30. If the pumping really is, the order will work and bring you profit. If there is no sharp jump in the course during the expected period, simply cancel the order. By the way, this is the safest way to make money on pumping. It&#8217;s suitable for experienced traders who know how to analyze market trends and have free assets for placing orders. The average net earnings of an ordinary investor from pumping are about 5%. Therefore, the more you invest, the more you can get.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"types\"><span id=\"what-are-the-main-types-of-pumps\">What are the main Types of Pumps?<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1380\"  height=\"480\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-10697 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 1380px) 100vw, 1380px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/types-of-crypto-pumps.png\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/types-of-crypto-pumps.png 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/types-of-crypto-pumps.png 1024w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/types-of-crypto-pumps.png 768w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/types-of-crypto-pumps.png 1920w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/types-of-crypto-pumps.png 1536w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/types-of-crypto-pumps.png 2048w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/types-of-crypto-pumps.png 380w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/types-of-crypto-pumps.png 1380w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Short-term&nbsp;&#8211; the value of a currency is raised to unprecedented heights in a matter of seconds. This type of pumping requires a large number of traders. Usually, a timer is set for a time when the trading pair will be announced on which cryptocurrency will be bought. Further, all pump participants are informed of the planned % growth. As soon as the time comes to an end, the name of the currency you want to buy is laid out on a public channel. Unfair communities buy this currency beforehand and place sale orders in advance for 50% of the planned growth percentage.Example of a pumping timer<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"768\"  height=\"396\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-10709 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pumping-timer.png\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pumping-timer.png 768w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pumping-timer-300x155.png 300w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Long-term&nbsp;is a pump that lasts from several minutes to several days.

The reaction was instantaneous: the price of Cloakcoin increased by 50% (to $ 5.77) on the exchange and in two minutes dropped to almost a dollar.

Most of them coordinate all activities in Telegram and Discord, where the total number of participants at the end of July has reached 236,000 people. The creators of Big Pump Signal, as well as other active groups, retain complete anonymity. Many of them charge a monthly fee for participating in a group &#8211; from $ 50 to $ 250. It isn&#8217;t known what amounts a regular participant earns in such communities, but administrators definitely have an advantage: they choose a coin, buy it at the lowest price and sell it at the peak they set.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"are-pumps-and-dumps-illegal-why-you-should-not-participate-in-pumps\">Are pumps and dumps illegal?

You understand that organizers of such channels use the power of tens of thousands of participants and often earn not only on the strategy of Pump &amp; Dump but also on paid access to their private exclusive chat rooms. Such actions in the stock market (from there this strategy has appeared) are equated to fraudulent ones, but one can argue with that. Each broker warns the trader about the potential risks of losing a deposit. And every trader agrees. A person is driven by the desire for easy money, and if he loses money without a detailed analysis of the market and knowledge solely because of greed, then who is to blame? In addition, most of the pump participants know about what they are getting involved in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1380\"  height=\"480\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-10817 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 1380px) 100vw, 1380px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pump-and-dump-conclusion.png\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pump-and-dump-conclusion.png 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pump-and-dump-conclusion.png 1024w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pump-and-dump-conclusion.png 768w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pump-and-dump-conclusion.png 1920w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pump-and-dump-conclusion.png 1536w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pump-and-dump-conclusion.png 2048w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pump-and-dump-conclusion.png 380w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/pump-and-dump-conclusion.png 1380w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the world of traditional investments, pump-and-dump schemes are illegal. However, due to the lack of regulation in the field of cryptocurrency, they are very attractive in terms of quick and easy earnings. Opinions are divided into such groups: those who have lost money are stigmatized, calling this scheme immoral and criminal, those who are closer to the core, usually claim that this is a good way to clear the market of \u201cstupid money\u201d and increase investor awareness of crypto-bubbles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In principle, such schemes are no more immoral than advertising gambling or lotteries on TV &#8211; where there is money, there is always a risk, and without careful analysis, patience or at least good connections (as in the case of P &amp; D) there will be no profit.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Pump and Dump is a scheme that leads to very fast and fundamentally unreasonable growth of a cryptocurrency rate, then fall.
