Holders of the token are able to obtain rewards from the success of the exchange, as 50% of its overall trading fee revenue is shared with holders through the tokens. Rewards, received in the form of dividends, are proportional to the amount of Kucoin Shares one holds; that means the more KCS you hold, the bigger the reward you will receive. Due to the attractive passive income model, Kucoin is usually seen as the biggest competitor to Binance. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"KuCoin (KCS) Price 2020 The current price of KuCoin fluctuates around $1.04; the total market capitalization is $85,645,315&hellip;\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[167],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.4.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>KuCoin (KCS) Price | KCS Price 2020 | KuCoin Chart | KCS Value<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Get the most accurate info about KuCoin Price (KCS), price chart, trade volume, market cap and more.
