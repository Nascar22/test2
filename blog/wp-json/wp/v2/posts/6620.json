In 2017, when XVG price was $0.05 he said that it might rise by 100% in the nearest future. The same year he tweeted that his recommendation for buying is several most secure coins, Verge was among them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"verge-xvg-price-prediction-verdict-2020\">Verge (XVG) Price Prediction Verdict (2020)<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Verge is a project that strives to embody all the advantages of cryptocurrency. Its goal is to make money transactions quick, safe, secure and anonymous, getting rid of all the intermediaries. Their development and marketing policy seems to be trustable. All these factors show us that Verge has serious potential to rise \u2014 despite experts\u2019 opinions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are not financial advisors and our words shouldn\u2019t be taken as directions. But we think that Verge might be an interesting option of investment. This coin has a remarkable strength that will make it go soaring high.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there is one important thing. If you decide to get some Verge, you need a set of trusty tools to buy, store and exchange your crypto.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"what-is-verge-xvg\">What is Verge (XVG)?<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Verge is a decentralized cryptocurrency project. The foundation behind Verge is focused on making the coin one of the most secure and untraceable payment methods in the world. It\u2019s even was initially launched under the name DogeCoinDark in 2014. Later, in 2016 the project was rebranded becoming Verge that we know nowadays. The project\u2019s native coin has the same name \u2014 Verge with XVG ticker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, Verge puts its value in principles of community-driven management and transparency. The coin has an open-source code and all the updates are developed and implemented counting users\u2019 opinions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many other altcoins, Verge project aims to make a coin with advantages over Bitcoin. It definitely has some: it is cheaper, much faster and much more private. Verge has a huge emphasis on becoming a coin for everyday use. This is the reason why they try to improve adoption, speed, privacy, and ease of use. As an example, the project has official bots in all major social media platforms \u2014 users can tip each other using these bots.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically there is no company behind Verge as it\u2019s fully driven by its community. Moreover, there are no official names of team members. The main Verge\u2019s document is their blackpaper \u2014 unofficial whitepaper signed only with nicknames. No one except the real Verge team knows who really stands behind the project. In fact, the project is supported by volunteers. The only name known is Justin Sunerock \u2014 a person supposed to be the founder of DogeCoinDark and Verge. But there is no confirmed information about him, so this might be a nickname, too \u2014 much like Satoshi Nakamoto.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"verge-xvg-technical-features\">Verge (XVG) Technical Features<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Verge has quite a quick blockchain with 30 second block time. It is 20 times faster than Bitcoin\u2019s expected block time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to embody features of anonymity and privacy Verge integrates several soft solutions into the blockchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>TOR. It stands for \u2018The Onion Router\u2019. The Onion is a world-known internet security technology that provides anonymity to users. This technology is implemented in many ways: there are official TOR browser and a lot of different apps using the technology to keep the user invisible. The router directs the traffic through several servers hiding real IPs making it very hard to track the user.<\/li><li>I2P. It is short for the \u2018Invisible Internet Project\u2019. It is another web technology that splits the traffic into 2 parts, leads it through different tunnels and encrypts it. I2P makes tracking even more difficult.<\/li><li>Wraith Protocol. It is an additional measure of security for Verge users. It makes the ledger private, so no one can reveal who made a transaction and who received the funds.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, people who send Verge never expose any identifying information. There are different explorers for XVG transactions, but the only data they display are amount, date and time. No sender wallet, no receiver wallet, only common information that some XVG were sent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"verge-xvg-market-features\">Verge (XVG) Market Features<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/cThNTM-TxlClKFuC7WOoevPcablayFstUXKkdrFw94z03yeAcJwgxteFoOuVRBSHnopXf-6uI2DbWILbkz5d5K58ihmxIXnk-LUOOwrgqBh3pKlvBg-ViTwe3r3xpWd1cW8rlMbC\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As of this writing in December 2019 current Verge price is $0,004 per coin. The highest Verge price was fixed on December 23, 2019, on the mark $0,3006. The all-time low was $0,000002 on February 5, 2015, shortly after the coin\u2019s release. The current market cap at the moment of creating this material is $63 825 618. The circulating supply is 16 087 675 679 XVG, with a maximum limit of 16 555 000 000 XVG. According to the CoinMarketCap rating, Verge has the 69th line in the overall cryptocurrency rating by market cap volume.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout its whole history, XVG price has been rushing to the sky two times. It happened at the end of 2017 when all the crypto market went skyrocketing and in the next year, in spring 2018. Verge price slowly decreased to the end of summer 2018 and been trading in a sideways since then. 2019 was quite stable for the coin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/h8AFMHKh8I5MOjTpCYbBAkh2fEMcmtg95agIqUiQZ11K1Er9p8UNmmFcCPFM9X8SV4gSUhWYUVir2VrVViMV7qG7TJLIcausNEP-c49B1YD1pCZmGcfnXzKUsTBYHNW6u24R-_x7\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"verge-news\">Verge News<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"xvg-prepares-a-hard-fork\">XVG Prepares a Hard Fork<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As it was seen in the previous paragraph, Verge is approaching its maximum supply. It is expected to occur in May 2020. On top of that, the block reward becomes smaller and smaller while XVG price is not rising. This all leads to some serious updates which in fact will be a hard fork. Verge team admits that and hints that the major rule changes for Verge\u2019s blockchain are quite possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"xvg-gains-after-paypal-stops-partnership-with-pornhub\">XVG Gains After PayPal Stops Partnership with Pornhub<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>PayPal banned Pornhub in November 2019 blocking payouts for more than 100 000 models. After that people started paying attention to other payment methods. Verge made a deal with the adult movie giant in April 2018 \u2014 by the way, it was one of the reasons Verge price went skyrocketing in spring 2018. After the news that PayPal is no more into the adult industry, XVG got a 168% increase in daily trading volume within the next 24 hours. Along with that Verge price rose by 33% the same day but it was corrected in the following week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"51-attacks\">51% Attacks<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Verge had two 51% attacks on the blockchain in 2018. It happened in April and then in May, right after implementing the critical update. Both attacks influenced the Verge price causing it to drop. But, it\u2019s important to say that there were no dysfunctions after that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"how-to-buy-and-store-verge\">How to Buy and Store Verge<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Atomic wallet is one of the best ways to manage your crypto portfolio.
