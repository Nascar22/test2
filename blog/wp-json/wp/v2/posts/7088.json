Due to its features, it will attract users and gain value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"factors-affecting-the-growth-of-bytecoin-bcn\">Factors Affecting the Growth of Bytecoin (BCN)<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the factors affecting Bytecoin\u2019s growth is technological advantages. Bytecoin is fast, and it confirms transactions within two minutes. It is faster than most cryptocurrencies. Also, it is anonymous, and it makes it easier to send transactions privately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, Bytecoin has a maximum supply of 184.47 billion coins and a total supply of 184.067 coins. The coin is almost reaching its maximum supply. Bytecoin will be scarce. According to the law of demand and supply, the higher the demand, the lower the supply, and vice versa. It means that Bytecoin&#8217;s price will appreciate due to scarcity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bytecoin\u2019s development team is working to provide new improvements that will allow them to access new markets. Its target audience is the Middle East, Asian, and African markets. In addition, the project is securing new partnerships with other companies. The company is developing more active channels of communication.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than providing financial services, Bytecoin blockchain carries other data, such as business data and geographical information. Bytecoin is also planning to add several features, such as incorporating smart contracts into its platform. In addition, they are planning to add multiple application programming interfaces (API) so that it can boost Bytecoins interactions with other software.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"bytecoin-bcn-price-prediction-verdict\">Bytecoin (BCN) Price Prediction Verdict<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some issues are changing very fast globally. People&#8217;s need for privacy and coveted online anonymity is more important than ever. Various governments are implementing oppressive techniques for limiting people&#8217;s privacy through censorship. There is a need for privacy while online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The need for anonymity and privacy is what drives Bytecoin\u2019s growth. Bytecoin is a completely untraceable digital asset. Most coins in the crypto market offer fiat currencies and other transactions that are traceable. On the other hand, Bytecoin has built its project on the need for online anonymity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Bytecoin has been building more partnerships with companies while improving its communication with users. Bytecoin is also planning to incorporate smart contracts into its platform. The technological advancements will make Bytecoin an attractive investment option. Due to the growing uses of Bytecoin, they are developing multiple layers of APIs to improve its interaction with other software.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to its technological improvements and expert analysis of the digital asset, Bytecoin is a favorable investment option. Its price will appreciate due to its scarcity and a growing number of users. You should take advantage of the current prices to make extra money in 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-bytecoin-bcn\">What is Bytecoin (BCN)?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bytecoin has a primary goal of developing a financial system that is more effective and reliable than the existing ones. The coin aims to be more flexible and scalable according to the dynamic crypto market. Bytecoin (BCN) is a peer-to-peer (p2p) payment system that was developed with blockchain technology.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike most cryptocurrencies, Bytecoin offers its users with privacy and anonymous transactions using CryptoNote stealth addresses and ring signatures. It was the first coin to implement privacy-enabling technologies into its transactions. It is among the top 100 cryptocurrencies according to market capitalization. Also, it has a devoted and solid following that has kept the coin relevant to date.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bytecoin offers instant private transactions globally through the Bytecoin network. The transactions are untraceable and do not need additional fees. Bytecoin allows its users to participate in the network by allocating the computer\u2019s computing power. The move allows transaction processing to be decentralized. It allows you not only to be a user but also a participant in the network. The choice to participate in the network is entirely your choice. You can get a reward for network maintenance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"history-and-main-features-of-bytecoin-bcn\">History and Main Features of Bytecoin (BCN)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is one of the earliest developed coins. It was built in 2012 and launched in 2014 by an anonymous team of privacy enthusiasts. The team ensured that transaction privacy is secured by cryptographic algorithms so that no one can find out the money that was transferred, who sent the money, and who received the money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bytecoin is decentralized. It uses blockchain technology that is managed by multiple nodes located in various areas globally. Its open-source code allows anyone to participate in Bytecoin&#8217;s network development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BCN\u2019s payments are untraceable. The coin uses ring signature technology that results in strong and completely anonymous payments. All addresses are obscured, and it is impossible or extremely difficult to perform identifying blockchain analytics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Transactions and addresses cannot be linked. Linking transactions is impossible because users have multiple one-time addresses that are generated from their public keys. No one can view the payments you have transacted and the users you have transacted with.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BCN has a flexible blockchain that does not have hard-coded constraints. It means that the blockchain can readjust difficulties according to changes in the network&#8217;s hash rate. The coin can easily adapt to network capabilities and states so that it can run efficiently and smoothly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"bytecoin-bcn-price-chart\">Bytecoin (BCN) Price Chart<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Bytecoin (BCN) Price Chart\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/96TLZGuWYqkhm6wTGiP38W-2ZbAU8lXYntS8h5Ohn6dBzIcLiOfdv4qAoSoLmMM9JgWgIXcpGYwkLGEMKI6ExYpngtiVlCX7y3fdvHi_AKDqkur6TM8B2Kup7S7xaG-H2evpnCXr6JTFE1Mw_g\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Figure 1 showing Bytecoin&#8217;s Price Chart from December 2018 to December 2019<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-buy-bytecoin-bcn\">How to Buy Bytecoin (BCN)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You should buy Bytecoin because it is a store of value.
