However, not everyone knows that cryptocurrencies are a subject of taxes. Have you heard about that? If not, read this guide that will disclose hidden stones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cryptocurrency taxation sounds confusing as taxes symbolize a regulation imposed by a central government while crypto assets and blockchain technology are associated with decentralization. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been spreading worldwide. Some of them even became a part of the state policy (e.g., Venezuelan Petro). That\u2019s why it\u2019s not surprising that countries are looking for ways to control them. One of such methods is to make cryptocurrencies a subject of taxation. Taxes cover different aspects of the cryptocurrency market. They are trading, mining, loans, margin trading, and decentralized finance. In this article, we will talk about cryptocurrency trading and its taxation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many countries, tax legislation is still an issue to solve. However, some have already succeeded: The United States, many European and Asian countries are among them. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the major principles of Bitcoin taxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"bitcoin-taxes-in-the-us\">Bitcoin Taxes in the US<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first tax guidance was issued in 2014 but it didn\u2019t cover many issues. In October 2019, the<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">&nbsp;Internal Revenue Service (IRS)<\/a>&nbsp;released a&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/individuals\/international-taxpayers\/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">cryptocurrency FAQ&nbsp;<\/a>and an official&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-drop\/rr-19-24.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2019-24<\/a>&nbsp;Revenue Ruling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems strange that you should pay taxes for cryptocurrencies. However, the Internal Revenue Service considers crypto assets as property. This means that you have to report your capital gains and losses the same as you do for your stock, real estate or any other owned property.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s worth making yourself comfortable and learn how to make tax reports.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step is to determine either the event is taxable or not. According to the IRS guidance, the following events require you to report on cryptocurrency gains\/losses:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7   If you trade a cryptocurrency to a fiat currency like the USD;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7   If you trade a cryptocurrency to a cryptocurrency (calculate the fair market price in the USD at the time of the trade);<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7   If you use a cryptocurrency for goods and services (calculate the fair market price in the USD at the time of the trade);<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7   If you earn cryptocurrency as an income (mining or wage income) \u200d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200dAt the same time, there are events that exclude tax payments.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 \tIf you give a cryptocurrency as a gift;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 \tIf you transfer a cryptocurrency between exchanges or wallets without experiencing capital gains\/losses;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 \tIf you buy a cryptocurrency with the USD (until you trade or use it).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, when you know when you have to report cryptocurrency gains\/losses, it\u2019s time to count how much you need to pay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"tax-calculation\">Tax calculation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To calculate taxes, American cryptocurrency holders should determine the fair market worth of the traded cryptocurrency at the time of the purchase, basing on the published exchange rates and including the value of appreciation and depreciation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, you need to determine the cost basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cost basis is the original value of an asset for tax purposes, usually the purchase price (source: Investopedia.com).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When talking about cryptocurrency, the cost basis consists of the purchase price and all other costs related to purchasing the cryptocurrency. Such costs may include transaction fees and commission that you pay to your broker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Formula:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Purchase Price of Cryptocurrency + Other Fees) \/ Quantity of Holding = Cost Basis<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s assume you invested $500 in Ether, so you would buy 3.89 Ether. Imagine you had to pay a fee of 1% to an exchange. Your cost basis is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>($500 + 1%*500)\/3.89 = $129.82 per Ether<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, you need to deduct the cost basis from fair market value (sale price). Counting it, you will define your capital gain\/loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fair market value or sale price is the price at what cryptocurrency holder sells the asset.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Formula:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fair Market Value &#8211; Cost Basis = Capital Gain\/Loss<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s imagine you decided to sell one Ether after the price reached $250 per unit. It\u2019s a taxable issue as you traded crypto to fiat currency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>250 (fair market value) &#8211; 129.82 (cost basis) = $120.18<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your capital gain equals to $120.18.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>$120.18 is the sum you need to pay taxes for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long-term vs short-term taxes<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taxes are also classified by a period of holding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; \tIf the cryptocurrency is sold within 1 year after purchase, the owner will pay a short-term capital gains tax.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; \tIf the cryptocurrency is sold after 1 year, the owner will pay a long-term capital gains tax. The percentage (0%, 15% or 20%) depends on taxable income and filing status.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>US taxation is one of the most complicated. That\u2019s why American traders prefer using special apps that ease their lives counting gains and losses, creating records. Useful sources will be listed later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have figured out how to count gains. But what if you survived losses? Will you need to pay taxes?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-if-you-survived-losses\">What If You Survived Losses<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a tax reduction strategy that may help to reduce your taxes at the year-end. The idea of the strategy is to sell a capital asset at a loss to offset taxes on both gains and income. A great feature of cryptocurrency losses is that capital losses offset other types of capital gains.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply saying, if you bought Bitcoin for $2,000 and the price of Bitcoin fell to $1,300, you survived a $700 loss. At the same time, you gained $5,000 trading stocks. You can use a $700 loss to offset $5,000 gain. In the end, you will pay a tax for $4,300.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"remember-about-3-000\">Remember about $3,000<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You should take into consideration a $3,000 figure. If your net capital loss is less or equal to $3,000, the entire capital loss can be used to offset other types of income.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if the loss is bigger than $3,000, the amount above $3,000 will be carried forward to the next tax year.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"wash-sale-rules\">Wash sale rules<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine you bought a cryptocurrency and survived losses. However, you still want to hold this cryptocurrency. All you need to do is to buy another cryptocurrency with that you already have. The loss you survived will be reported in the paper. After that, you will be able to buy your cryptocurrency back. At the same time, you will use this reported loss to offset other gains.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you may think: what if I avoid reporting? It may be a bad decision. The IRS will consider that as a tax fraud that may be followed by criminal prosecution and a penalty of up to $250,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"bitcoin-tax-worldwide\">Bitcoin Tax Worldwide<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>America is not only a country that requires tax reports.
