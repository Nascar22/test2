The number of people accepting Nano as a payment method in the future will boost its price growth. Nano has gained a good reputation among some major influencers who believe that Nano is one of the best investment decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its rebranding has had a positive impact on the coin. When RaiBlocks was renamed Nano, it has gained a better attraction in its target market. Within 24 hours after its rebranding in nearly 2018, the coin experienced a 40% price growth. The new name is resonating better with the mainstream audience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nano is one of the simplest cryptocurrencies available. Cryptocurrencies may be confusing, especially to new investors. Its simplicity has allowed it to stand out regardless of the high competition in the crypto market. It is a payment coin that offers impressive scalability, solid fundamentals, zero fees, and almost-instant fees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its partnership with Twitch will boost its presence in the mainstream market.

Nano has the potential to exhibit enormous growth in 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the main test of Nano\u2019s stability in the long term is its ability to perform in a competitive environment. Its anti-spam Proof of Work concept that is infinitely scalable provides high hopes for success in the global market. Its zero-fee transaction capability is appealing not only to cryptocurrency enthusiasts but also the society.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The crypto industry is quite volatile, and price changes occur within seconds. It may be difficult to predict Nano&#8217;s specific price in 2020, but all the factors indicate that its price will increase in 2020. As more people accept Nano as a method of payment, its value will appreciate. You should take advantage of the current price to make extra money in 2020.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-nano\">What is Nano?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nano aims to conduct its tasks within the blockchain at a faster rate than other cryptocurrencies. It seeks to revolutionize blockchain technology by providing zero-fee transactions in real-time with minimal or zero energy consumption.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nano wants to make money efficient and promote equality in the world. It ensures that the coin is simple to pay with, open to everyone, and easy to integrate with other real-world transactions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It uses a radically different consensus algorithm and data structure than other cryptocurrencies. Nano uses a block-lattice data structure where each coin address has its own blockchain. it is the only cryptocurrency that uses the block-lattice technology. Most coins have a single sequential list of blocks that contain transactions. While most coins maintain consensus through Proof of Work, Nano maintains consensus through voting.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"brief-history-of-nano\">Brief History of Nano<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nano used to be called RaiBlocks when it was launched in 2015 by Colin LaMahieu. LaMahieu had years of experience in software engineering. The man reason the project changed its name to Nano from RaiBlocks is that the initial name did not resonate with the target audience. Within 24 hours after it changed its rebranding, its price surged 40%.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nano uses a Direct Acrylic Graph (DAG) in addition to its block-lattice architecture. DAGs allow multiple chains of blocks to be interconnected and coexist without forming an edge. Block lattice architecture allows each user to be assigned their own blockchain, known as account-chain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main concerns in the crypto industry is the increase in transaction fees. Nano addresses the concern by providing a zero-transaction fee currency. No fees are paid to miners, and the exchange is free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nano\u2019s transactions are instant and real-time. Coin holders do not have to wait for the network ledge to update. The transaction information is updated by the owner and then updated in the bigger block-lattice. The move has resulted&nbsp; in lowering transaction times. Additionally, it has a lower energy consumption than most cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nano is infinitely scalable. It can process 1000 times more transactions per second than major cryptocurrencies. It means that you will never get stuck in a queue, and your transactions are instant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"nano-price-chart\">Nano Price Chart<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/NbfKsn9jkE7HR8Ux9Pzv8KWizO-UHT16nxB5rNSq1_JWLX6iMbl8YraFPU2lzAOByxck3GRvqocTv9miB3c754LkvbOBARY38Bm7mc7s0hkYjseWU0o617NBUpWr-8Cn8NSSG03CZXkMrNA7zA\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Figure 1 shows Nano&#8217;s price chart from December 2018 to December 2019&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-buy-nano\">How to Buy Nano<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You need a cryptocurrency wallet to buy Nano.
