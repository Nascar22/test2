The main purpose of this framework is to serve as a fast, scalable and contemporary platform for decentralized applications (that are also called dApps). The platform is claimed to become a new type of decentralized network. It is centralized on agents (similar to nods in a traditional blockchain) instead of being data-centric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Holochain applies a new form of blockchain management structure. The project rejects the traditional blockchain concept where participants confirm and make records of the whole blockchain. In order to provide much better scalability and performance, agents run their own private blockchains that are connected to the main net with a special cryptographic key. The overall data is synchronized on a regular basis by the net\u2019s algorithms or users\u2019 decisions. It is more like a distributed concept than a decentralized one, but it\u2019s still a fresh idea that can change the world of crypto.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of this writing in December 2020, the mainnet is still under development, so the announced Holo fuel coin hasn\u2019t gone live yet. Instead of that, the team ran the ERC20-based token called Holo or HOT in order to raise funds for the project. The ICO was held in March an May 2018, the token was released on the mass market in May. HOT is listed on numerous exchanges including Binance, Hotbit, Latoken, and Bilaxy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team behind the project is headed by co-founders Arthur Brock and Eric Harris. Both are computer specialists and experienced entrepreneurs. The company was created in December 2016 and is based in San-Francisco, the USA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project seems to be quite promising for now. It is reflected in HOT\u2019s positions \u2014 it is, for instance, in the top-50 of CoinMarketCap\u2019s rating. With such ambitious plans, Holochain is highly possible to become a huge player, so it\u2019s vital to take a look at the HOT\u2019s price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"holochain-wallet\">Holochain Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your crypto wisely!
