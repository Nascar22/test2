Building an application on one of these all-in-one blockchain networks binds one to the platform&#8217;s limitations, including its bottlenecks and governance decisions, while also benefiting from that network&#8217;s user base. Polkadot uses a technology that allows specialized chains\/ networks to seamlessly exchange messages and communicate with other specialized chains\/ networks. Polkadot technology comprises four core features:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/wiki.polkadot.network\/docs\/en\/learn-architecture#relay-chain\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Relay chains<\/a>. These are aimed at creating&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/c\/consensus-mechanism-cryptocurrency.asp\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">consensus<\/a>, interoperability, and shared security across the network of different chains. The Relay Chain is the major chain of Polkadot. The Relay Chain comprises a relatively small number of transaction types, including ways to interact with the governance mechanism, parachain auctions, and participating in network activities, hence, minimizing the functionality of the relay chain.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This feature allows dozens of blockchains to run in parallel while being connected through one relay chain. It is estimated that a relay chain will be able to host about one hundred parachains. This feature would create a system that would have about one hundred times the current&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/what-is-proof-of-stake\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Proof-of-Stake<\/a>&nbsp;system&#8217;s scalability. An improved version of Polkadot could have multiple relay chains attached to the root relay chain developed with&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.substrate.io\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Substrate<\/a>, the same technology stack that most parachains are being built with. This could allow for up to 1,000x to 10,000x scalability compared to current Proof-of-Stake systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/wiki.polkadot.network\/docs\/en\/learn-parachains#:~:text=A%20parachain%20is%20an%20application,them%20to%20be%20actual%20blockchains.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Parachains<\/a>. Parachains are independent chains with their tokens and specific use cases. Parachains comprise heterogeneous blockchain shards, while the leading Polkadot Relay Chain secures every other component. Peter Mauric, head of public affairs at Parity Technologies, told CoinDesk in an email,&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;Parachains can process more transactions than a single blockchain because the transactions are spread across multiple computers, similar to parallel processing.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A significant player in the Polkadot network&#8217;s development is Parity Technologies, a for-profit European-headquartered firm that focuses on building tools for the open-source Polkadot platform.&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.parity.io\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Parity<\/a>&nbsp;is the company behind Substrate, a set of tools for developers and tech-driven individuals and project teams to create blockchain applications and web3.0 applications on Polkadot. In the words of Polkadot co-founder Robert Habermeier,&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<em>&#8220;Substrate is a set of libraries for doing all the things that are annoying about writing blockchains.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Substrate effectively puts aside the individual functionalities and activities of a blockchain as modules while grouping them enough so that libraries can still use them effectively for different scenarios. While this is done, Substrate always ensures that their manageability enables near-instant implementation. Substrate has been developed as a useful tool to create blockchains that will easily connect to Polkadot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/wiki.polkadot.network\/docs\/en\/learn-parathreads\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Parathread<\/a>. Like parachains but with flexible connectivity, parathreads function to allow parachains to temporarily participate or be involved in Polkadot security without leasing a parachain slot. Using parathreads, any development team can gain full access to the Polkadot relay chain and bootstrap their application, as well as be involved in the Polkadot network&#8217;s shared security. Parathreads require a minimal bond (50\u2013100 DOTs) and permit chains to submit a block to the relay chain while reaping the relay chain&#8217;s full security and connectivity benefits. Applications that gain heavy adoption and usage can raise the requisite DOTs and upgrade to a full parachain. This upgrade can be done by swapping with an existing parachain.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the traditional isolated security system where interconnected chains have individual security levels, and the chain with the weakest security defines the system&#8217;s overall safety, Polkadot gives the same security guarantees for all parachains by pooling their security and delegating it to the Polkadot relay chain via the parathread.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/wiki.polkadot.network\/docs\/en\/learn-bridges\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bridges<\/a>. Bridges allow parachains and parathreads to communicate and connect with external blockchains. Bridges leverage Polkadot shards to enable easy and seamless communication with other blockchains like Ethereum or Bitcoin blockchain. In early 2021, Interlay will introduce Polkadot&#8217;s first trustless wrapped Bitcoin (polkaBTC) to promote interoperability in the Polkadot ecosystem. There are two types of bridges in the Polkadot ecosystem:<ul><li>Bridge modules. Bridge modules are possibly system-level or community-deployed parachains which serve the sole purpose of being consensus-adaptors to external chains. Bridge modules allow non-parachains to act as a &#8220;virtual parachain&#8221; while extending the external or the other chain&#8217;s functionality, with the interoperability benefits of Polkadot. Bridge modules are based on particular chains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. This means that blockchain networks that are based on the latter will be easily supported as well.<\/li><li>Bridge contracts. Similar to bridge modules, bridge contracts exist on specific parachains that support smart contracts, linking Polkadot and any other smart contract capable or intelligent contract enabled blockchain.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantages of the Polkadot blockchain, which cannot be overemphasized, include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>On-chain governance: Polkadot native token (DOT) participates in governance decisions like voting transparently.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Security:<\/strong>&nbsp;Rather than using the vulnerable&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/proof-of-stake-vs-proof-of-work\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Proof-of-work<\/a>&nbsp;or Proof-of-Stake models to secure its network, Polkadot lets blockchains pool their security by aggregation, making it very secure compared to the Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake models.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Polkadot uses a GHOST-based Recursive Ancestor Deriving Prefix Agreement(GRANDPA) consensus&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/academy\/cryptocurrency-algorithm\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">algorithm<\/a>&nbsp;to ensure network security, scalability, and resilience.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Dr. Gavin Wood was presenting Substrate on stage at Web3 Summit 2018, Berlin.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"polkadot-ecosystem\"><strong>Polkadot Ecosystem<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Polkadot is a unique blockchain protocol that functions to connect individual blockchain networks into one blockchain network efficiently. Just like the Ethereum-driven ICO craze of 2017, where over 30-50% of cryptocurrency and blockchain projects at the time launched\/ built on the Ethereum blockchain and further pushed Ethereum to the position of the second most famous and valuable cryptocurrency, Polkadot&#8217;s entry into the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry has resulted to many projects building on its blockchain. The issues and challenges of scalability, speed, and cost of transaction faced by the Ethereum blockchain have encouraged blockchain and cryptocurrency projects to migrate to and\/or build on the Polkadot blockchain, taking advantage of its seamless, efficient and interoperable network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rise in the adoption of&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/consensys.net\/blockchain-use-cases\/decentralized-finance\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">DeFi<\/a>&nbsp;(Decentralized Finance) has also catapulted the demand for a more efficient and interoperable blockchain like what Polkadot offers. Many Polkadot projects are built using Substrate, the blockchain development framework for parity.io, enabling developers to build high-value applications on Polkadot. The Polkadot ecosystem comprises over three hundred blockchain and cryptocurrency projects. These range from wallets to decentralized exchanges, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Smart contracts, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and Automated Market Makers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/paralink.network\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Interlay<\/strong><\/a><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interlay is the major Polkadot protocol making decentralized finance interoperable.

Despite some unfortunate events that led to the loss of over half of the raised funds, Polkadot endured, and the company further conducted two private sales. One in 2019 and the second one in the summer of 2020. During Polkadot&#8217;s ICO in October 2017, DOT tokens were sold at an average of $30 per coin. On August 21st, 2020, the DOT token was effectively redenominated by a factor of 100, and existing holders received 100 new DOT for the old ones they held. In other words, ICO investors have seen a massive increase of roughly around 2000%.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DOT is currently priced at $16.86 with a total supply of 1billion coins and a market capitalization of $16.1 billion, making it the fourth most valuable cryptocurrency.
