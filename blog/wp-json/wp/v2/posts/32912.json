Bitcoin is the most valuable cryptocurrency or digital asset in the world. It dates back to 2008, while in 2009, it became accessible. Bitcoin is a digital resource created to ease the transfer of funds. Most importantly, it enhances a third-party free transaction process. Also, users do not need to disclose their identities while making payments. All transactions across the Bitcoin blockchain are irreversible and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, Bitcoin sits at a market cap of over $600 million out of the total $1 trillion for the crypto market in general. Therefore, Bitcoin is the largest and most valuable asset in the crypto market. According to Bitcoin News, Bitcoin&#8217;s current price is about $33,800. BTC&#8217;s maximum supply is 21 million, while its circulating supply is over 18,616,000. Other crypto coins also claim to have a decentralized system, but Bitcoin remains the first-ever digital asset ever to exist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"bitcoin-price-chart\">Bitcoin Price Chart<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Bitcoin Price Chart\"  class=\"wp-image-32913 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Bitcoin-Price-Chart0A.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"btc-price-prediction-for-btc-2021\"><strong>BTC Price Prediction for BTC 2021<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of 2020, the Bitcoin coin price went as high as crossing the $30,000 mark. The big bull run went on till the beginning of 2021, and BTC price crossed $40,000. This price is about a 248% increase in Bitcoin price USD from 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Afterward, the hype and media were all over it, and everyone started to carry the Bitcoin news. Many were grateful to have bought the dip, while some people expressed their regrets for not buying early. However, not everyone was optimistic about the Bitcoin price at the end of this year. Some analysts still see a sharp drop in 2021, just like it happened after the 2017 bull run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/price-prediction\/ripple-xrp-price-prediction-2021\"><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\">Read more on Ripple price prediction 2021.<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"bitcoin-predictions-for-2021\"><strong>Bitcoin predictions for 2021<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mike McGlone Bitcoin Price Prediction 2021<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Mike McGlone on Bitcoin Prediction.\"  class=\"wp-image-32968 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Mike-McGlone-Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-20210A.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While speaking in an interview, Mike McGlone from Bloomberg stressed the reason for the Bitcoin surge. &#8220;<em>What I&#8217;m worried about \u2013 looking at its performance, Bitcoin is potentially indicative of the future.

He said the asset would trade at $318,000 by the end of 2021. Tom admitted that painful corrections would follow the unthinkable rallies. Meanwhile, he said that Bitcoin was the new gold with fewer restrictions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"bitcoin-price-prediction-2021\"><strong>Bitcoin Price Prediction 2021<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several reasons why investors can be bullish on Bitcoin predictions. Between 2020 and now, a good number of institutional investors and hedge funds have bought into Bitcoin. Popular mobile software provider MicroStrategy bought BTC worth $650 million in December 2020. Currently, the firm holds about 70,470 Bitcoins, equivalent to more than $2.4 billion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has the most significant Bitcoin investment so far. The company holds some 572,644 Bitcoins, which is about 2% of BTC&#8217;s total supply. Grayscale Investments has over $21 billion in Bitcoin. Likewise, Grayscale also runs the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund. This hedge-fund too exposes investors to digital assets such as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Meanwhile, as of January 2021, 81.6% of the fund is invested in Bitcoin alone. As a result, about 7,036 BTC worth $279 million is held by the fund.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other financial institutions like the CoinShares Group, London-based Ruffer Investment Company, and more have also bought BTC with millions of dollars. Moreover, world-leading asset manager BlackRock recently showed its interest in Bitcoin Futures investments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is imperative to note that institutional investors are coin &#8220;HODLERS.&#8221; They did not buy BTC for circulation but to lock it up till further notice. So, there is bound to be a reduction in the circulating supply of Bitcoin. Limited supply and an increase in demand breed a bullish market. We will not be surprised then to see BTC predictions fulfill and one Bitcoin sold for $100,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"bitcoin-price-prediction-2025\"><strong>Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From now till 2025, BTC price is expected to surge very high. As a result of multiple streams of institutional investments, Bitcoin supply will become scarcer. Thus, the law of demand and supply will come into play and push BTC price to a massive high.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from a correction, other things might happen that might drive Bitcoin&#8217;s current price lower. If countries make laws against cryptocurrencies, this might cause bad news. Also, hacking of exchanges and selling pressure might cause roadblocks for BTC. However, in the long run, any of these might never happen. Even if it does happen, it might have no adverse effect on Bitcoin value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, by 2025, we expect a six-figure price per BTC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"verdict-on-bitcoin-predictions\"><strong>Verdict on Bitcoin Predictions<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No doubt, Bitcoin is the most valuable digital asset in the world. With Bitcoin&#8217;s current price and its market cap value, it has over 60% dominance on the crypto market. Therefore, Bitcoin is an investment that will always be worth it. Like the Stack-to-Flow model and other financial analysts suggest, a limited supply will drive BTC price above $100,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin is a safe investment for buyers. Many investors are buying BTC to ensure their money doesn&#8217;t lose value to inflation. No matter the&nbsp;<strong>Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt<\/strong>, Bitcoin value always increases. Thus, this is a good asset for every crypto trader in 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To buy BTC, you can make use of the Atomic Wallet Interface.

Ethereum has broken above the $1400 resistance zone and recently hit the $1500 milestone. Thus, ETH is set for new highs this year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ETH price is also subject to higher levels due to Ethereum 2.0 launch and more extensive DeFi adoption. Ethereum 2.0 was launched close to the end of 2020. Meanwhile, over 3 million ETH currently worth $4.2 billion is locked in the project.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, Defi projects are gaining higher ground. UniSwap is on top of the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) ecosystem with $23.3 billion. Remember, Ethereum is an underlying asset for decentralized finance. About 7.21 million Ethereum is locked in Defi. Thus, the more Defi projects gain ground, the higher this will push Ethereum price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since January 4, Ethereum&#8217;s price has not gone below the $1,000 mark. Thus, providing us an optimistic Ethereum price prediction. There are massive investments in Defi and bullish moves by Ethereum. We can safely predict that Ethereum&#8217;s price will close above $2,000 by the end of 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Bitcoin Price Prediction.
