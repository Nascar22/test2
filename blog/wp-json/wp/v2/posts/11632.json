The circulating supply is 31,152,840 GRIN, while there is no information on the total supply of GRIN. The daily trading volume is around $25,402,069 or 3,121 BTC. Grin is trading on several major markets, yet the most active exchange that trades GRIN is Gate.io.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-time high of Grin, $10.00, was reached on January 28, 2019 &#8211; outside the most famous cryptocurrency bull-run of Winter 2017-2018. On the other hand, the all-time low of GRIN, $0.870336, occurred fairly recently on October 25, 2019. Currently, the estimated ROI (return on investment) of Grin is -90.29%, which means that $100 worth of GRIN bought at the time of the Grin launch would not yield any profit today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The short price history of Grin has been a rather turbulent one. In 2019, when the currency first appeared on the cryptocurrency market, the initial price was set at $261. In just a day, however, the price fell by almost 98%, reaching $7.5. The obvious explanation was the hype that surrounded Grin way before it was released. The demand far outstripped the early supply of the token. However, due to the monetary policy of Grin, the number of tokens quickly grew, and the price leveled out. During the first six months of trading, the price of GRIN took up various values between $12.56 and $1.89.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, the monetary policy of Grin can provide valuable insight into its future perspectives. As of today, a new GRIN is created every second, and it is likely to remain so in the near future. For the first four years of existence, Grin&#8217;s creation was similar to that of Bitcoin. However, while the block reward of Bitcoin halves every four years, it stays the same for Grin. The inflation rate of Grin slows down much faster than that of Bitcoin. The thing is, Grin has an infinite maximum supply, which is why new tokens make up a smaller portion of the total amount over time. In 10 years, the inflation rate will fall down to 10%, in 20 years &#8211; to 5%, in 25 years &#8211; to 4%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This kind of monetary policy was designed in an attempt to prevent the early hoarding of GRIN. A high inflation rate is likely to reduce the emergence of &#8220;whales&#8221; who have a lot of power over the price of the token. Thus, late adopters have as much access to GRIN as early adopters. As you can tell, GRIN was not designed as a value-storage asset, but rather an accessible exchange currency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The developers of Grin, as well as many other cryptocurrencies, are still experimenting with the monetary policy and supply schedules. For instance, Monero, another privacy-focused digital currency, has a completely different supply schedule. In the end, however, any classical cryptocurrency is, by definition, more secure than fiat currencies that can be inflated at the discretion of centralized banking systems.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-grin\">What is Grin<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Grin (GRIN) is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that is an early implementation of the MimbleWimble protocol. Some of the privacy-enhancing features of Grin are hidden addresses and hidden amounts. The Grin blockchain is by several parameters more efficient than some of its competitors: for instance, its transactional capacity is higher than that of Monero (XMR).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the coin itself was created only in January 2019, the roots of Grin can be traced back to August 2016, when an anonymous developer posted a whitepaper for MimbleWimble on a Bitcoin development forum. A few months later, another anonymous developer confirmed that a practical implementation of MimbleWimble called Grin was in development.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The programming language used in Grin is Rust, notable for its speed and scalability when used in building network applications. Grin runs on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism and utilizes the cuckoo cycle hashing algorithm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"grin-wallet\">Grin Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your crypto wisely!
