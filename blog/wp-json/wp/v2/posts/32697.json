A genuinely pioneering project based on an advanced multi-chain framework, it also introduced us to its native DOT token in August of last year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The coin was launched with three primary purposes, namely staking, bonding, and providing governance over the network. Interestingly, DOT isn&#8217;t categorized as an ERC-20 coin, which means that it doesn&#8217;t follow the list of standards used to regulate exchanges on the Ethereum platform. Instead, it&#8217;s considered a blockchain-based cryptocurrency and one that saw its price fluctuate within the narrow range of $3.014564 and $5.251094 between August and December last year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The end of 2020 saw something of a price hike for the cryptocurrency, however, with the Polkadot value breaking through the $10 barrier for the first time on January 6th. This trend has continued largely unabated during the subsequent four weeks, with the DOT price reaching a new high of $21.53 on February 4th. The Polkadot coin price is also poised for further growth in the coming weeks, with this generating continued speculation about the token and driving increased trading volumes in the process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those of you who hold DOT tokens in your wallet can manage these in the Atomic Wallet, of course, along with up to 500 additional coins.&nbsp;<strong><em>However, we&#8217;ll touch on this further a little later in the piece.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-polkadot-dot\">What is Polkadot (DOT)?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Polkadot project&#8217;s pioneering nature is borne out by its core premise, creating an advanced, third-generation peer-to-peer network for numerous blockchains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The protocol was developed by the Swiss-based Web3 Foundation, utilizing a simple blockchain setup and allowing for interoperability between different and developing blockchains. The network is also defined by a sophisticated governance process, with its considerable promise underpinning a successful 2017 ICO, which raised more than $140 million. Despite this and raising more than $200 million from investors over the last three-and-a-half years, Polkadot also incurred significant losses during this period and saw its launch date continually delayed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following two separate rounds of the private sale in 2019 and 2020, however, the Polkadot mainnet was finally launched in May 2020. From its starting point of $2.70, the DOT coin price enjoyed an initial hike, and subsequent correction as early adopters realized their profits before soaring to its recent high above the $20 mark at the beginning of February.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, some have discussed the striking similarities between Polkadot and Ethereum, particularly in terms of the facilitation of transactions between independent blockchains and the DOT coin&#8217;s reliance on staking rather than mining to govern network growth. Of course, these two technologies also share the same founder (Graeme Wood), creating a scenario where both assets have witnessed periodically strong price correlations since last summer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-32712 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/dot-market-prediction.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"a-market-prediction-for-the-polkadot-dot-price-in-2021\"><em>A Market Prediction for the Polkadot (DOT) Price in 2021<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As we can see from the chart above, the Polkadot coin price, in particular, has seen significant growth during the last five weeks, thanks largely to a significant increase in demand and the increased availability of tokens across exchanges nationwide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what exactly will 2021 bring for the Polkadot coin price? Here&#8217;s a selection of opinions from crypto experts:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"coinpedia-polkadot-price-prediction-for-2021\">Coinpedia Polkadot Price Prediction for 2021<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Coinpedia has predicted a sustained continuation of the DOT price rally that began at the end of 2020, based on technical analysis of the coin and its surrounding network. More specifically, they forecast Polkadot price gains of up to 25% during the first half of 2021 alone, with the token poised to close out the year around the $50 mark.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"digitalcoinprice-dot-price-prediction-for-2021\">Digitalcoinprice DOT Price Prediction for 2021<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The experts at Digitalcoinprice largely share the opinion of their counterparts at Coinpedia, although they&#8217;re marginally less aggressive in their forecasts. They&#8217;ve correctly predicted Polkadot&#8217;s current price and that the token would break through the $20 barrier in early 2021, making their bullish forecasts of 100% price growth over the year seem more than feasible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"walletinvestor-polkadot-price-prediction-for-2021\">Walletinvestor Polkadot Price Prediction for 2021<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Walletinvestor is renowned for creating forecasts based on AI-generated technical analysis, although this has revealed a much less positive outlook for DOT&#8217;s future. It predicts that the DOT price will plunge by around 90% to $1.541 during the next 12 months, but this is largely based on intangible factors and should probably be taken with a pinch of salt. This Polkadot price prediction also appears unlikely given the DOT&#8217;s current price and trajectory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"coinarbitragebot-polkadot-price-prediction-for-2021\">CoinArbitrageBot Polkadot Price Prediction for 2021<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The forecast from CoinArbitrageBot treads the middle ground between our previous predictions, estimating a slight decline in value to $14.7503 from DOT&#8217;s current price by the end of 2021. This is based largely on DOT&#8217;s historical price data, although its longer-term outlook for the token is considerably more positive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-32701 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/RippleCoinNews-Polkadot-Price-Prediction.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ripplecoinnews-polkadot-price-prediction-for-2021\">RippleCoinNews Polkadot Price Prediction for 2021<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our final input comes from RippleCoinNews, which has forecast steady growth for the Polkadot price throughout 2021 (from its starting point of just $9.025999 at the beginning of the year). After peaking at $27.39 in February, it will trade within a narrow range and achieve a value of $23.68 by the end of the year, representing one of the most modest Polkadot predictions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"dot-price-prediction-for-2021\">DOT Price Prediction for 2021<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a mix of opinions about DOT&#8217;s short-term growth prospects through 2021, with our selected Polkadot price predictions suggesting that the token&#8217;s value could be anywhere between $1.541 and $40 by the end of the year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coinpedia, Digitalcoinprice, and RippleCoinNews all produced accurate forecasts for February of this year and continue to suggest that the DOT token will see either modest or exponential price growth as 2021 unfolds. This certainly makes sense when you consider that the token is becoming more widely accessible on international exchanges; the decision of asset manager 21Shares to launch a Polkadot ETP on Switzerland&#8217;s SIX exchange will enable even more&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/93495\/21shares-launching-polkadot-dot-etp\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">investors to hold the native DOT coin as stock<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not the only piece of Polkadot news to wow investors of late. The Mantra Network has recently&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/manta-aims-to-bring-a-private-decentralized-exchange-to-polkadot-with-1-1m-raise\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">closed a $1.1 million funding round<\/a>&nbsp;to create a fully decentralized and private exchange protocol. This swell of positive Polkadot news and a significant increase in demand, which will be further fuelled by the promising nature of the protocol and the DOT&#8217;s sustained rise against the dollar, should drive noticeable price hikes in the near-term and throughout 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"the-dot-coin-price-prediction-for-2025\">The DOT Coin Price Prediction for 2025<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If we look to 2025, we see similarly bullish forecasts for the DOT price. In the case of Coinpedia, for example, they&#8217;ve made a maximum DOT price prediction of $70.20 for the end of 2022, while the four-year outlook through 2025 sees the token rally between $120 and $150.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other experts are a little more conservative with their DOT price predictions, of course, with Trading Beasts expecting the token to break through the $40 barrier by the end of 2024. However, the maximum price around this time could push the $50 mark before growing by a further 100% in the subsequent 12 months until the end of 2025.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s an undeniably bullish outlook for Polkadot and its native token through 2025, especially as the protocol begins to fulfill its immense potential as an interoperable blockchain. The predicted devaluation of the US dollar could also fuel price rises in this respect, as will further commercial partnerships and positive Polkadot news stories as they&#8217;re announced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"our-polkadot-price-prediction-verdict\">Our Polkadot Price Prediction Verdict<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The DOT current price is certainly embarked on an upward trajectory, with this also being influenced by a surge in sentiment for second-generation tokens such as Ethereum and Ripple. With most experts also predicting sustained growth through 2022 and 2025, there&#8217;s no doubt that Polkadot represents an interesting investment option from a short&nbsp;<strong><em>and<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;medium-term perspective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With price growth over 100% forecasted by some experts over the next 12 months alone, now may also be the ideal time to invest in Polkadot tokens. This is especially true when you consider Polkadot&#8217;s value in real-time, which remains genuinely competitive compared to other coins. Currently, the DOT coin price about Bitcoin remains as low as 0.000536 BTC, so there&#8217;s a clear window of opportunity to exchange tokens to generate a profit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that you achieve this while managing your DOT coins in the Atomic Wallet, creating an opportunity for you to buy or exchange up to 500 different tokens. You can also stake DOT tokens with annualized returns of around 5% while benefiting from 24-hour support.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Atomic platform is also secure and allows for complete anonymity, as your private keys are completely encrypted and there&#8217;s no need for any identifiable accounts or additional Know Your Customer (KYC) protocol.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-buy-the-dot-coin\">How to Buy the Dot Coin<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you decide to buy DOT sooner rather than later in 2021, the Atomic Wallet is the ideal place to get started. Simply install the Atomic Wallet on your desktop or mobile device before initially verifying your identity to negate the risk of theft or fraud. You&#8217;ll have to provide clear copies of photo identification such as a passport or drivers&#8217; license to achieve this aim, with this typical across most wallets and exchanges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can then get started with as little as $50 while funding your new wallet with your choice of credit and debit cards. You&#8217;ll then receive DOT tokens into your wallet, where you can securely store your coins alongside other assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. If you&#8217;re a mobile user, you can download the Atomic Wallet on both iOS and Android devices, while you can check out the various currencies accepted&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/polkadot-wallet\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-exchange-dot-coin\">How to Exchange DOT Coin<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are various advantages to exchanging DOT coins in the Atomic Wallet, particularly when considering the huge range of exchange pairs available to investors. Not only this, but Atomic Wallet also offers genuinely competitive rates, allowing you to make the most of your investment and optimize your profitability over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also participate in Atomic&#8217;s first decentralized wallet program based on its native token (AWC).
