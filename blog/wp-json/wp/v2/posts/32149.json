The pool tokens can be moved, exchanged, and used in any dapps that support the ERC-20 standard. After reclaiming these funds, the pool tokens are burned. Each of them indicates a user&#8217;s share in regard to the total assets&#8217; amount and the pool&#8217;s 0.3% trading fee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-are-the-uniswap-tokens-distributed\"><br>How are the Uniswap tokens distributed?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1 billion UNI tokens have been minted at genesis and will become accessible over the course of 4 years. The initial four-year allocation is as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>15% of UNI&nbsp;[150,000,000 UNI]&nbsp;can be claimed now by past Uniswap liquidity providers, users, and SOCKS redeemers\/holders.

Since its inception, Uniswap has been utilized as a highly decentralized and trustless financial infrastructure with no intermediaries, centralized party, facilitator of trade, or order book. Smart contracts determine each pool to enable the tokens swapping, add liquidity, as well as gain commission in the form of exchange fees for contributing to the liquidity pools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uniswap was created by Hayden Adams, a graduate of Stony Brook University with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in engineering (2016). Before Uniswap, Hayden was an engineer at Siemens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"uniswap-uni-faq\"><br>Uniswap (UNI) FAQ<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-uniswap-current-price\"><br>What is Uniswap current price?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>$4.50&nbsp;USD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-market-cap\"><br>What is the Market Cap?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>$435,581,955&nbsp;USD with the #38 current rank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-24h-trading-volume\"><br>What is the 24h Trading Volume?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>$1,904,407,871&nbsp;USD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"all-time-high-all-time-low\"><br>All-Time-High \/ All-Time-Low?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>ATH \/ ATL: $8.39 USD (Sep 18, 2020) \/ $1.09 USD (Sep 17, 2020).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-circulating-supply\"><br>What is the Circulating Supply?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>96,866,285&nbsp;UNI (1,000,000,000&nbsp;UNI in total).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"UNI, Uniswap Protocol governance token, was launched on September 17, and now is added to Atomic Wallet among with other 20+ DeFi assets in the list.
