A good portion of internet bandwidth is now used to stream videos. This industry keeps growing and will only continue to grow in the coming years. However, the current centralized video streaming platforms have various inadequacies plunging their services. That is what Theta has come to solve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theta is a decentralized platform that is introducing video streaming and video content into the blockchain space. Theta has the vision to provide \u2013 Next-generation video delivery powered by everyone. Steve Chen, a co-founder of YouTube, who is also part of the Theta team, said:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Theta&#8217;s innovation will disrupt today&#8217;s online video industry much like YouTube did to traditional videos back in 2005. One of our biggest challenges has been the high costs of delivering videos, and this is only getting bigger with higher quality video streams. I&#8217;m excited to be part of the next evolution of the streaming space.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To achieve its vision of delivering seamless, high-quality streams up to HD and 4K resolutions at low cost, Theta is looking to bring everyone&#8217;s resources together. How? They plan to employ the unused storage and bandwidth of users on the network. Thus, there will be enough room for videos of very high resolutions while participants receive rewards for their contributions. As said, video streaming platforms like YouTube, Netflix, and Live.ly continue to grow. Major social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter even have live video options. However, these videos become blurry most times, especially in developing countries where internet service is poor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theta team is innovating a lasting solution for video delivery using distributed blockchain technology. Thus, Theta Labs have been able to build the first Decentralized Streaming Network. Theta Labs is the parent company in charge of the Theta blockchain. Jieyi Long and Mitch Liu co-founded Theta Labs in 2018. Jieyi Long has multiple experiences in gaming, virtual reality, design automation, and distributed systems. He also holds patents in virtual reality, video streaming, and blockchain technology. Likewise, Liu has multiple experiences in the entertainment industry, including co-founding THETA.tv. The very first decentralized application built on the Theta network is THETA.tv.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Theta blockchain has two native tokens, Theta (THETA) and Theta Fuel (TFUEL). THETA exists as a governance token and, at launch in 2018, was a token on the ERC-20 network. Theta held a one-year-long private token sale which ended in 2018. The company was able to raise $20 million during the initial sale. However, Theta now runs its main net, and all THETA tokens use the network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Theta Fuel (TFUEL) powers the internal economy of the Theta blockchain. The Theta blockchain uses the Proof-of-Stake financial incentive scheme to ensure its users participate in governance activities. This way, the network is secured by participants and holders of the Theta token. Also, the blockchain utilizes the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) mechanism to balance its security. The multi-level BFT also ensures faster transactions, and the network can process up to 1000 transactions per second.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To easily calculate user engagement with live videos, the network relies on the Proof-of-Engagement protocol. This protocol provides transparent reports of users who have watched a video and rewards them. Hence, advertisers, creators, and viewers can efficiently measure their video streaming engagement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"theta-price-chart\"><strong>Theta Price Chart<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1280\"  height=\"720\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-34484 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/dev.atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Theta-Price-Chart.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Theta has existed since 2018. However, it became tradable on Binance in April 2019. At that time, Theta coin price was $0.135 before dumping below 10 cents a month after Binance&#8217;s listing. It was able to recover and kept on increasing in price. Theta&#8217;s current price is $4.30, and its all-time high is $4.8. In March 2020, Theta price USD was 0.03977, and this price is the coin&#8217;s all-time low. Theta coin price is still on the rise, and possibly, it will continue to reach new all-time highs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"market-prediction-for-theta-theta-price-2021\"><strong>Market Prediction for Theta (THETA) Price 2021<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Theta&#8217;s current price, like other cryptocurrencies, is moving with the current market trend. Its all-time high is a recent price, so we may continue to have more highs if the market proves bullish. Going back, Theta price as of January 2018 was around $0.2, and it did drop significantly to as low as $0.039. However, since the Binance listing, Theta coin price continues to climb higher. Stats from various Theta news shows that the Theta project has a substantial audience in the cryptocurrency market. Theta ranks 18 among over 8,700 on the list of cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap. According to Theta&#8217;s current price chart, the coin has formed support levels at $1.84 and $2.85. Since 2021, the Theta coin price has not broken any of these pivot points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, Theta&#8217;s market capitalization and fully diluted cap are $4,301,936,592. THETA&#8217;s daily trading volume is over $190 million, and more than 90,000 traders have it on their watchlist. THETA coin has a circulating supply, total and maximum supply of 1 billion (1,000,000,000) tokens. THETA serves as a governance token and is distributed among the Theta network participants, including the Theta team. The Theta network also powers decentralized applications on its smart contract platform. However, developers power transactions using Theta Fuel (TFUEL). TFUEL is another token of Theta with a 5 billion total supply.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"theta-predictions-2021\"><strong>Theta Predictions 2021<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Will Theta grow or decrease in 2021?

Also, they endorsed the THETA coin as a profitable investment in 2021. Their THETA value speculation is about 2x of Theta&#8217;s current price. This forecast is a very realistic one as altcoins rally in price, especially during a bull run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"wallet-investor-theta-predictions-for-2021\"><strong>Wallet Investor Theta Predictions for 2021<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Walletinvestor.com currently marks the Theta coin as an excellent investment for one year. While their one-year prediction for Theta Price USD is $7.22, they see the cryptocurrency increasing by 440% in five years. This price prediction is almost the same as Digital Coin&#8217;s forecast.

He stated his viewpoint in a video made in December 2020 about the potential of Theta network&#8217;s THETA and TFUEL. According to Coin Bureau, TFUEL currently has a 5 billion token supply, but the figure is inflationary. Also, TFUEL serves as a means of payment on the blockchain, so buying pressure could keep its price down. However, THETA has a fixed non-inflationary supply with a solid use-case. Thus, THETA price has a strong bullish potential in 2021 more than TFUEL. Coin Bureau did not give a specific Theta price prediction in his video.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1280\"  height=\"720\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-34488 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/dev.atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Coin-Bureau-Theta-Price-Prediction-20210A.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"previsioni-bitcoin-theta-price-prediction-2021\"><strong>Previsioni Bitcoin Theta Price Prediction 2021<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Previsionibitcoin.com is an expert price prediction website for cryptocurrencies. Previsioni Bitcoin predicts that the Theta coin price will be almost $11 by December 2021. They base this heavy boost in Theta price on the coin&#8217;s use-case. According to Previsioni Bitcoin, the Theta network and its token will receive massive attention to boost Theta news. Thus, in 2021, Theta&#8217;s value will grow more, and its capitalization will consequently increase. Of course, a coin for the very first blockchain-based video streaming platform has a strong potential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1280\"  height=\"720\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-34489 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/dev.atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Previsioni-Bitcoin-Theta-Price-Prediction-20210A.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"theta-price-prediction-2021\"><strong>Theta Price Prediction 2021<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The blockchain-based video streaming platform has some big plans to execute in the 2021 calendar year. Theta news includes some impressive roadmap the company has for 2021:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>&nbsp;The launch of a decentralized exchange on the Theta network in quarter one of 2021<\/li><li>&nbsp;Launch of Theta mainnet 3.0 in quarter two<\/li><li>&nbsp;Theta official app for Ledger and Trezor wallet also in Q2 of 2021<\/li><li>&nbsp;Release of Version 2 of the Edgecast Decentralized Streaming App (Dapp) \u2013 Q3 2021<\/li><li>&nbsp;Version 2 of the Advanced Smart Contract Developer \u2013 Q4 2021<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Theta co-founder Mitch Liu also laid out another plan for this year \u2013 the Edgecast Node platform. This platform will deliver local ingest and encoding of streams, fully decentralized streaming, chat, and event notifications. Similarly, Theta Edgecast will be the world&#8217;s first decentralized streaming Dapp for end-to-end live streaming and video delivery. According to Liu, there is a rapid growth in Theta.tv and the native cryptocurrencies of the Theta network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another exciting announcement from Theta news is the Google Chrome extension for Theta Wallet. This update is a substantial achievement because Theta has just partnered with the world&#8217;s biggest search engine. By April 20, Theta is expected to launch the THETA MAINNET 3.0, which in their roadmap is set for Q2 of 2021. This new network upgrade will introduce TFuel staking and uptime mining and burning. Participants who want to stake TFUEL will have to download the THETA Edge Node.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Announcements, upgrades, and improvements like these are enough to make THETA price skyrocket in 2021. Theta news is impressive, and this is enough to excite investors. No wonder THETA is on over 90,000 watchlists on CoinMarketCap. Theta is a promising blockchain project, and Theta coin price may go beyond expectations in 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"theta-price-prediction-2025\"><strong>Theta Price Prediction 2025<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1280\"  height=\"720\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-34490 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/dev.atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Theta-Price-Prediction-20250A.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For all crypto assets, 2025 is still a long way. A year ago, Bitcoin&#8217;s price was much less than $10,000. However, it recently hit over $57,000 in February. Theta could do the same in the long run as a result of its unending use-case. Remember, the video streaming industry is predicted to grow immensely, especially in the coming years. So, a decentralized and low-cost video streamer like Theta will also follow the growth trend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expert prediction websites like Digital Coin are as well bullish on the long-term price of Theta. According to the Digital-coin-price algorithm, Theta price by 2025 will be up to $12 and even more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As above, Wallet Investor is also very bullish on Theta price USD future price. They provide a five-year forecast of up to a 440% increase in Theta&#8217;s current price. Thus, a $1,000 investment from now will yield a $4,400 profit by 2025. These Theta predictions are achievable by 2025.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"theta-price-prediction-verdict\"><strong>Theta Price Prediction Verdict<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Theta project is worth the hype. Theta Labs and the team have been able to achieve meaningful partnerships. From 2018 till now, Theta is only three years old. Many cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects have been existing before Theta. However, Theta leads some of these projects in use-case, real-world usage, partnership, and coin price. Also, there is some interesting Theta news worth discussing. In December 2020, Theta started to introduce smart contracts to their Mainnet. From January 2021, Theta has added three new partnerships, including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>WorldPokerTour.com<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 WorldPokerTour integrated Theta Network to launch an exclusive channel powered by Theta.<\/li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Lionsgate:<\/strong>&nbsp;On February 11, Theta announced that famous Hollywood filmmaking studio Lionsgate introduces its contents to Theta Network.<\/li><li>&nbsp;<strong>Sony Europe<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 In March 2021, Sony Europe joined the Theta Enterprise Validator program. Existing Enterprise Validator Nodes were Samsung, Google, Binance, Gumi, and Blockchain.com.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of the first digital asset and cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, wanted to decentralize money and finance in general, and it was a success. Founders of Theta want to decentralize video streaming and entertainment and are becoming successful. In the next few years, when Theta fully decentralizes video streaming, Will THETA become the next Bitcoin and TFUEL the next Ethereum? The answer is only subject to time. Theta is a promising cryptocurrency, and Theta&#8217;s value might be set for new highs in the nearest future. If you find Theta a worthy crypto investment in 2021, you can manage Theta on the Atomic Wallet app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-buy-theta\"><strong>How to Buy Theta<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Atomic Wallet provides a secure and decentralized cryptocurrency wallet.
