The term Blockchain itself partially describes the tasks that this technology solves, meaning literally \u201cchain of blocks\u201d. And not just some chain. It maintains a strict sequence of actions and a system of relations. At the same time, to write a new block, it is necessary to sequentially read information about the old blocks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"regulation\"><span id=\"blockchain-regulation\">Blockchain Regulation<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1380\"  height=\"480\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-10552 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 1380px) 100vw, 1380px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/blockchain-regulation-definition.png\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/blockchain-regulation-definition.png 1380w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/blockchain-regulation-definition-300x104.png 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/blockchain-regulation-definition-768x267.png 768w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When we\u2019re talking about \u201cregulation\u201d in cryptocurrency context, it most likely refers to following basic concepts:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Know Your Customer (KYC).<\/li><li>Anti Money Laundering (AML).<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Also there are rules regarding issuance and trading of securities. Regulations in case of securities serve the purpose to protect investors and ensure that funds are used for their intended purpose (and for legitimate purposes). The KYC and <a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/anti-money-laundering-aml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"AML (opens in a new tab)\">AML<\/a> rules were created to verify the identity of clients and assess the risks of their use of business relations to counter money laundering or other illegal activities.<br>The rules of KYC and <a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/anti-money-laundering-aml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"AML (opens in a new tab)\">AML<\/a> are usually compulsory for all banks and financial institutions, although this varies from country to country. In 2018, most crypto companies and exchanges made minimal efforts to establish the real identity of their customers. This pattern had to be changed quickly. Considering that Crypto companies understand that they need to follow with KYC and AML experience to avoid potential regulatory repression.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"mass-adoption\"><span id=\"blockchain-mass-adoption\">Blockchain Mass Adoption<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite this desire to make blockchain as free as possible, in order for it to be widely distributed in given investment community, there must be some degree of adaptation with traditional ways of investing by introducing its regulation. The massive adoption of blockchain is due to the high degree of protection against hacker attacks, which is embedded in blockchain system itself, in which there is no single server, it is possible to control the transactions by any member of the community. In addition, blockchain, as a technology, has led to the possibility of transferring values \u200b\u200bwithout boundaries between participants and innovative ways to attract capital or investments in promising projects. Another reason for massive adoption of blockchain is that the number of mobile Internet users in the world is growing sharply.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"why-regulation-is-needed\"><span id=\"why-do-we-need-blockchain-regulation\">Why do we need blockchain regulation?<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there is another side to it: cryptocurrency is used as the main exchange of values \u200b\u200bfor illegal activities, and people are deceiving an uneducated investor with&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/security-tokens\">fraudulent ICOs<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, blockchain regulation exists to protect investors from fraud. The regulatory standard provides a certain level of protection for an inexperienced investor. However, imposing restrictions on who can invest in unregistered securities significantly depletes the number of potential investors, which causes inconvenience for honest projects, but also sets barriers to raising money for bad or outright fraudulent companies. Strengthening regulation will reduce the investment risk of blockchain and increase institutional investment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"integration\"><span id=\"integration-with-the-real-world\">Integration with the real world<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1380\"  height=\"480\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Integration with the real world\"  class=\"wp-image-10564 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 1380px) 100vw, 1380px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/blockchain-real-world-integration.png\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/blockchain-real-world-integration.png 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/blockchain-real-world-integration.png 1024w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/blockchain-real-world-integration.png 768w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/blockchain-real-world-integration.png 1920w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/blockchain-real-world-integration.png 1536w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/blockchain-real-world-integration.png 2048w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/blockchain-real-world-integration.png 380w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/blockchain-real-world-integration.png 1380w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, many state authorities are considering the possibility of using the blockchain technology for storing and exchanging documents with heading \u201cFor official use\u201d and \u201ctop secret\u201d.

Congress held a total of seven hearings on blockchain and digital currencies, all from 2013 to 2017. Starting from the impact of virtual currencies on protection of small and medium-sized businesses, national security to the impact of breakthrough technologies and threats to cybersecurity. In total, two federal blockchain bills relating to virtual currencies, the Law on Protection and Moratorium on Cryptocurrency Protocol and the Law on Protection of Online Market 2014, were proposed. Even these bills were far from revolutionary: they proposed a five-year moratorium on federal and state regulation of cryptocurrencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"us-governments\">US governments<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017, without much media attention, Arizona quickly passed a bill recognizing blockchain records, amending existing legislation on electronic records. The Arizona House Bill 2417, introduced on February 6, 2017, passed both state chambers and was signed by law on March 29, 2017.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, the bill was passed to Washington State Senate that encourages the development of distributed book and blockchain technology. The bill provides for legal recognition of digital signatures when checking blockchains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The state of Wyoming also proposed a bill that would allow issuing tokenized share certificates using blockchain technology. Bill aims to clarify the legality of digital assets and permit storage of digital assets through banks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To date, California has not made any attempts to further regulate the blockchain or digital currencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Hawaii, on January 25, 2017, a draft law \u201cAct on Economic Development\u201d was submitted. This bill establishes a \u201cworking group consisting of representatives of the public and private sectors to study, train and promote best practices in implementing blockchain technology\u201d for the benefit of local enterprises, residents and the state of Hawaii.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On March 21, 2017, the Illinois House of Representatives adopted a Joint Resolution of the House of Representatives 25, in accordance with which a task force was created to explore the benefits of the blockchain for local government records.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important events for the regulation and implementation of the blockchain in evidentiary context occurred in Arizona (recognition of smart contracts), Vermont (blockchain as evidence), Chicago (real estate records) and, most importantly, in Delaware (awaiting initiative Delaware companies in the form of a blockchain). Because it includes 64 percent of Fortune 500 companies and more than 1 million legal entities, adopting a Delaware initiative will change the regulatory framework for securities, setting a precedent in the most important US corporate jurisdiction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"eu-regulation\"><span id=\"blockchain-regulation-in-europe\">Blockchain Regulation in Europe<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1380\"  height=\"480\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Blockchain Regulation in Europe\"  class=\"wp-image-10600 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 1380px) 100vw, 1380px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/blockchain-regulation-in-europe.png\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/blockchain-regulation-in-europe.png 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/blockchain-regulation-in-europe.png 1024w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/blockchain-regulation-in-europe.png 768w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/blockchain-regulation-in-europe.png 1920w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/blockchain-regulation-in-europe.png 1536w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/blockchain-regulation-in-europe.png 2048w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/blockchain-regulation-in-europe.png 380w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/blockchain-regulation-in-europe.png 1380w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, the main priority of Europe in relation to blockchain technologies is &#8211; creation of a clear regulatory framework. It is necessary to determine the legal status of tokens, order of cryptocurrency exchanges activity in European space. Having a clear legal framework will strengthen the confidence of banks. Creation of a single deliberative platform is an essential step towards the implementation of tasks set by European authorities. In particular, the EU has taken a firm position on data privacy, implementing strict rules that have noticeable implications for the blockchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>General Regulation \u201cOn Data Protection (GDPR)\u201d, which entered into force on May 25, 2019, is aimed at harmonizing data protection efforts in the EU.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"croatia\">Croatia<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Zagreb authorities seek to introduce blockchain technology and integrate it into daily activities of the state, especially in protecting confidential documents and monitoring business processes of local firms. The Blockchain technology has been identified as a secure means of storing official documents and digital certificates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"malta\">Malta<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>July 4, 2018 marks a historical day for Malta, as the Parliament of Malta officially passed 3 laws, setting first regulatory framework for blockchain, cryptocurrency, and DLT (distributed accounting technology). This makes Malta the first country in the world to provide official set of rules for operators in blockchain, cryptocurrency and DLT space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"asia-regulation\"><span id=\"blockchain-regulation-in-asia\">Blockchain Regulation in Asia<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Until recently, countries of the Middle East were using \u201cbusiness first, regulation &#8211; later\u201d approach, in which government agencies allowed blockchain companies to operate without restrictions. But since cryptoterms exploded, the East Asian countries began to subject blockchains under control by the regulatory authorities. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are reportedly launching official interbank cryptocurrency. At the moment, the project is at the experimental stage, and there is practically no information about it. Their goal at this stage for experiments is to gain a better understanding on implications of the Blockchain technology for facilitating cross-border payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While China was once considered an international refuge for crypto-conversions, this changed dramatically in 2017 when the National Bank of China banned the country&#8217;s initial coin offers (ICO), sending a clear signal that cryptocurrency exchanges in their current form would not be tolerated. South Korea followed through, although blockchain technology is usually encouraged within its boundaries, internal ICOs were banned for the foreseeable future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"singapore\">Singapore<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Singapore has a number of examples that proudly declare themselves as blockchain supporters. One in particular stood out for me: owned by the government of Singapore, Temasek Holdings and Singapore Stock Exchange invested in a platform that allows you to collect funds through the offers of security tokens. STO is, in fact, asset tokenization, and Singapore makes a big statement in its position for blockchain-based integration.<br>Singapore Public Service can also take on blockchain to check vendor&#8217;s track record on the GeBiz government&#8217;s e-procurement portal of Singapore, track government employee\u2019s career steps and audit processes. The Ubin project &#8211; another notable example of Singapore\u2019s participation in blockchain technology adoption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"south-korea\">South Korea<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, the blockchain community of South Korea has flourished. While the government is looking at blockchain technology favorably, it has yet to determine its position on legal and regulatory aspects of cryptocurrency financing and trading, leaving South Korean market uncertain. In addition, internal ICOs are prohibited.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"japan\">Japan<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Japan was one of the first countries in the world to recognize bitcoin as a currency and issued licenses for the exchange of cryptocurrency to enterprises seeking official classification in accordance with the law. At the same time, Japanese regulators limited their assessment of crypto-conversions exclusively to Bitcoin and are currently not ready to cover other enterprises operating on the blockchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"russia-regulation\"><span id=\"blockchain-regulation-in-russia\">Blockchain Regulation in Russia<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Federal Law No. 161 of June 27, 2011 (\u201cOn the National Payment System\u201d) defines electronic money.
