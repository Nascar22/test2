Since 2011, the crypto coin has consistently been among the top 10 largest capitalizations in the cryptocurrency market. Litecoin is one of the very first altcoins in the market. A fork of Bitcoin blockchain network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Litecoin has almost the same features as Bitcoin except in a few areas where there are unique and significant features. The cryptocurrency was created to solve the Bitcoin shortfalls and, most times acts as a test environment for the Bitcoin blockchain. These top features of Litecoin include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A &#8220;proof of work&#8221; that uses the Scrypt hash.<\/li><li>Four times faster block creation with an average interval of 2.5 minutes.<\/li><li>The total number of units is 84 million.<\/li><li>A mining difficulty that changes every two and a half days.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These features made it a top alternative to the Bitcoin network. In what many experts refer to the &#8220;digital silver,&#8221; where bitcoin is the digital gold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"litecoin-price-chart-nbsp\"><strong>Litecoin Price Chart:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-32540 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Litecoin-Price-Chart.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Litecoin Price started trading around $4.4 at launch in 2011 and quickly reached $30. The all-time low was recorded at $1.11 on January 24, 2015. Since then, Litecoin Price has incredibly increased, appreciating over 3000% since its launch until date.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the launch on October 7, 2011. The project was then listed on different cryptocurrency exchanges available. The first significant increase in the Litecoin Price was in 2011 after reaching $30 following launch. The Litecoin price quickly dropped to $5 on November 8, 2013. After ten days, the price increased to approximately $50 due to hype around Litecoin coin price on Litecoin news updates at this time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in late 2017, the price made a new all-time high at $70 and then jumped to the Litecoin all-time high of $400. This was recorded by year&#8217;s end in the overall 2017 bull run. The majority of the Litecoin news headlines at this time also contributed to the hype built around the Litecoin coin price. After the bull runs in 2017, the digital assets have fallen hard down to below $100. But in late 2020, the Litecoin value recorded a price drop, and later at this period, the Litecoin value went back up again. Though it&#8217;s yet to set a new all-time high at the recent 2021 bull market, it trades at the Litecoin current price of $144 below its all-time high in 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current market capitalization is $9.5 billion, while the Litecoin current price trades at $144 at the time of writing. LTC is also currently the eighth largest crypto in the world by market capitalization.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Litecoin current price at the time of writing is not up to half its previous all-time high (ATH). The Litecoin price USD target for most predictions in 2021 ranges around $142 and $198. We might see a price half of the previous ATH above the Litecoin current price before the end of the year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"market-prediction-for-litecoin-ltc-price-2021\"><strong>Market prediction for Litecoin (LTC) price 2021:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Litecoin predictions are currently tricky. However, many experts predicted a new all-time high above its previous highest all-time high of $375.29 on December 19, 2017. There are still Litecoin predictions with facts that the Litecoin value will record a new all-time high above its previous ATH.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at these publications and statements from eminent personalities featured across popular top Litecoin news channels on the Litecoin predictions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"trading-beasts-litecoin-price-prediction-2021\"><strong><em>Trading Beasts Litecoin Price Prediction 2021:<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-32551 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Trading-Beasts-Litecoin-Price-Prediction-2021.jpg\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Trading Beasts releases monthly predictions of different crypto assets based on &#8220;historical data and using a combination of linear and polynomial regressions.&#8221; As a result, the platform has Litecoin price predictions up until 2024.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Per the Litecoin predictions, the minimum LTC price drop will be in February 2020 at $97.544, while the maximum Litecoin price USD increase will stand at $143.448. The analysis shows a -20% decrease in price at the minimum Litecoin coin price drop in February. The Trading Beats group is more optimistic about the Litecoin coin price increase in the long run. The maximum price prediction for the year-end is $168.157. The analysis is that the LTC price will drop to a Litecoin price of USD 97.5, averaging at $144 for most of 2021, before hitting a potential $168.157 in December 2021. This is around a 15% increase of Litecoin&#8217;s current price at the time of writing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group claims that the if price stays strong at $168 in Dec 2021. It will potentially hit $217 by the end of 2022 and will keep increasing to a potential price of $268 until 2023.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"wallet-investor-litecoin-price-prediction-2021\"><strong><em>Wallet Investor Litecoin Price Prediction 2021:<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-32562 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Wallet-Investor-Litecoin-Price-Prediction-2021.jpg\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The team at crypto prediction portal Wallet Investor is pessimistic that the Litecoin price USD value will drop to around $61.736 sometime during 2021. This projection is based mostly on LTC price performance over 2019 \u2014 a period after the 2017 bull run during which Litecoin recorded the lowest low since 2017. Meanwhile, many of the conditions like usage and circulating supply surrounding the possibility of such a decrease in Litecoin price is still unfeasible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this Litecoin current price, such a decrease will be over 50% in the Litecoin value now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"the-long-forecast-litecoin-price-prediction-report\"><strong><em>The Long Forecast Litecoin Price Prediction Report:<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-32573 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/The-Long-Forecast-Litecoin-Price-Prediction.jpg\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a top research group that publishes analytics about various cryptocurrencies. They are quite optimistic that Litecoin&#8217;s future is bright. The group expects Litecoin price to close at $218 by May 2021 and a record high of $232 by Nov 2021. In the long run, the group expects the price to hit $1,216 in 2025.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"cointelegraph-markets-litecoin-price-prediction\"><strong><em>Cointelegraph Markets Litecoin Price Prediction:<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-32584 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Cointelegraph-Markets-Litecoin-Price-Prediction-1080x1080.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cointelegraph Markets linked the LTC price movement to the Silver price movement. The analysis was done with Silver in correlation with Bitcoin and Litecoin price action. They suggest that a Silver Price increase will determine how much Litecoin Price will increase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The data suggest that silver returns may work as a predictor for future Litecoin returns. From the model employed, if Silver&#8217;s return rose by 1% yesterday, we can expect that Litecoin returns may decrease by -0.232% today.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, while the silver price appreciates during the year, the Litecoin price will continue to decrease in return. So, a decrease in Silver Price can trigger an increase in return for the Litecoin price USD value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"digital-coin-price-prediction-for-litecoin-price-prediction-nbsp-nbsp\"><strong><em>Digital Coin Price Prediction for Litecoin Price Prediction:&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-32595 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Digital-Coin-Price-Prediction-for-Litecoin.jpg\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital Coin Price, a platform that makes its predictions based on historical data, also has an optimistic look at the future market price of Litecoin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform predicts that Litecoin Price should keep at an uptrend throughout the year. The platform expects the minimum low at around $90, while the maximum high for the year will hang around $195.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"litecoin-price-prediction-2021-nbsp\"><strong>Litecoin Price Prediction 2021:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The market price of Litecoin can reach $200 before the end of March.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many factors can drive the price up during this period. The digital asset is Silver to bitcoin in comparison. The blockchain technology of the digital coin is a direct upgrade of what bitcoin currently serves. The full potential is yet to be fully reached in terms of price. There is already an on-going wide adoption across the world, mostly in Asia and Africa.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In correlation to its counterpart Bitcoin, there is a huge potential for price increase in the future and now. Most importantly, the price, for now, can still get to $200 before year-end. However, most experts predict an insane price increase starting around 2023 &#8211; 2025. During this time, the price can get to over $1000.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another competitive advantage here is the integration of privacy protocol on Litecoin Transactions. The MimbleWimble Protocol is a protocol that will enable private Litecoin transactions. Incognito wallet users will be able to send and receive LTC tokens without third parties&#8217; ability to surveil funds. This feature creates an edge for Litecoin, among other privacy coins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"litecoin-price-prediction-2025-nbsp\"><strong>Litecoin price prediction 2025:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The third halving for Litecoin is set to take place in 2023. This is a POW token, and it&#8217;s created based on mining rewards. In doing so, block rewards would be halved to 6.25 LTC. This will reduce the halving reward for miners though bringing the ever-total supply to exist forever closer. Hence the closer it gets, the scarcer the supply becomes, and the price will relatively increase in value. On a usual occasion, the Litecoin halving event shoots the price of LTC up just like its counterpart Bitcoin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, the Litecoin price prediction by 2025-2030 is that its value has a higher possibility of surpassing its previous all-time high if it doesn&#8217;t happen before the halving date in 2025.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"litecoin-ltc-price-prediction-verdict-nbsp\"><strong>Litecoin (LTC) Price Prediction Verdict:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a final verdict for the Litecoin price prediction is impossible due to the uncertainties in the market. Litecoin is one of the crypto coins on the Grayscale portfolios, a top cryptocurrency investment platform headed by Michael Sonnenshein.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Grayscale Litecoin Trust is solely and passively invested in Litecoin, enabling investors to gain exposure to LTC in the form of a security while avoiding the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping LTC directly.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, this digital Silver serves as the best and better alternative to bitcoin, most especially in tech, enabling fast and cheap transactions for users. It&#8217;s usually referred to as the Silver of digital assets.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-32606 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Grayscale-Litecoin-Price-Prediction-1326x1080.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Grayscale investing in Litecoin is a verdict to investors on the potentials of the cryptocurrency in the future.
