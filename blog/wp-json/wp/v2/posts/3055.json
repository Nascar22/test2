The chart was quite stable with a minor decrease over the year except for December. In the last month of the year, the rate started to grow dramatically and reached $0,8866 at the year\u2019s closing day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This trend continued in January 2018.

After that, the price went down first, but shortly after, the price almost broke through the $2 line again \u2014 ZRX cost $1,94 on the 11th of May. The rest of the year was the period of a slow bearish trend. The year finished with $0,32 per unit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2019 was the year of sideways for 0x. It struggled for support and hardly broke the $0,36 line in April and May. The rest of the year was marked by trading above the $0,15 line. No serious falls or soars were not fixed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of this article writing in December 2019, the current ZRX price is $0,182994.

Many crypto experts and portals mark that and have a quite good opinion on the future of 0x.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Cryptoground prediction service foresees big gains in the next years.

Before making any investments, make your own research and remember that crypto is followed by risks. But still, our opinion is that 0x is a project worth noticing. ZRX is definitely an asset that must be considered as an investment option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-zero-x-zrx\">What is Zero X (ZRX)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Zero X, also known as 0x, is a decentralized blockchain platform designed to offer a cryptocurrency exchange of a combined type. To be clear, the project develops a decentralized exchange (that is also abbreviated as dEX) with off-chain ordering but on-chain processing. As an alternative way for trading, the platform offers an OTC mode of deals, when users negotiate and make an agreement outside the exchange.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>0x is built on the <a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/ethereum-wallet\">Ethereum<\/a> blockchain, so it also features decentralized applications (also known as dApps) and smart contracts that serve as tools for the exchange operations. The main principle of the 0x dEX is simple: when the person places an order, the blockchain translates it outside the ecosystem, and, if successful, then runs it inside the net. Being based on the Ethereum platform means that 0x can trade all known ERC20 tokens \u2014 it is over 500 assets as for this writing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another significant feature that the off-chain part allows making an exchange cheaper. For example, on a traditional Ethereum blockchain, a smart contract is created when a person wants to do something. A contract for making an order, another one for canceling it, another one for withdrawal \u2014 as a result, there are dozens of contracts and each of them requires a fee. 0x moves most of the action outside the blockchain in order to cut most of the fees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zero X is fueled with its native token called ZRX. It is based on the ERC20 technology with all standard features of this kind of asset. This token is used for all the fees within the blockchain. ZRX uses an open protocol to ensure higher security and fewer trust issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The foundation behind Zero X is headed by its two co-founders: Will Warren and Amir Bandeali. Both are experienced specialists in IT and fin-tech matters. For example, Will was an advisor in the Basic Attention Token project and Amir worked at Chopper Trading and DRW.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"zrx-wallet\">ZRX Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your crypto wisely!
