Do you know how many Bitcoins are already found? Find the answers and explore even more exciting BTC facts and figures in our Ultimate Guide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-many-bitcoins-are-in-circulation\">How Many Bitcoins Are in Circulation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the moment, 18,158,675 Bitcoins already exist. According to unofficial statistics, most of them are held by the USA, Romanian, German, Chinese and Czech citizens. The figures change every 10 minutes as a new block is obtained, and the new 12.5 BTC is added to the circulation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-overall-amount-of-existing-btc\">What is the overall amount of existing BTC<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoins are not an endless resource, and it steadily comes to an end. Only 21,000,000 BTC can exist, so today, more than 86% of total Bitcoin emission is already in action. But don&#8217;t worry: the halving of mining reward will continue to happen, and, as counted, the last BTC will be&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/bitcoin-mining\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">mined<\/a>&nbsp;in 120 years, in 2140.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-many-bitcoins-are-still-left-for-mining\">How Many Bitcoins Are Still Left for Mining<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As counted above, less than 14% of the overall Bitcoin amount is left for nowadays miners. The figures are continually decreasing as people find new blocks, but for now, the mark is at 2,841,375 BTC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-many-bitcoins-are-lost\">How Many Bitcoins Are Lost<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no 100% precise answer to the question since it is hard to know about every single case. According to the approximate estimations, about 4,000,000 Bitcoins are lost by careless crypto holders. These numbers make about 19% of the overall emission, though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-many-bitcoins-do-people-mine-every-day\">How Many Bitcoins Do People Mine Every day<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The current reward for a mined block is 12.5 BTC. Every day hard-working miners find roughly 144 blocks. As a result, about 1,800 BTC are mined daily across the world. However, there is no secret that crypto enthusiasts are constantly modifying their equipment to mine even faster, so sometimes, a new block is found every 9.5 minutes, not 10. So, that means that the amount of daily mined Bitcoin can sometimes be a little more than 1,800 BTC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-many-bitcoins-are-already-mined\">How Many Bitcoins Are Already Mined<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As crypto enthusiasts surely know, new Bitcoins can only be produced through mining. The calculations here are elementary: the circulating emission is equal to the amount of already mined BTC. It is 18,158,675 or about 86% of the overall possible Bitcoin supply at the moment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-total-number-of-found-bitcoin-blocks\">What Is the Total Number of Found Bitcoin Blocks<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the moment of writing the article, 612,691 blocks are already found by Bitcoin users. The number may seem huge at first glance, but make sure you know that when the last Bitcoin is mined in 2140, the amount will reach the 6,930,000 level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"who-created-bitcoin\">Who Created Bitcoin<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group of people who called themselves Satoshi Nakamoto. The real name of the BTC father is yet to be under-covered one day, or perhaps, we will never know who<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&nbsp;the genius actually is<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"satoshi-nakamoto-net-worth\">Satoshi Nakamoto Net Worth<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly to the number of stolen or lost Bitcoins, it is complicated to know for sure how rich Satoshi Nakamoto is. Some believe he has about 300,000 BTC, some suppose he holds a million coins, but the most realistic figures are somewhere around 700,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-many-bitcoins-have-been-stolen\">How Many Bitcoins Have Been Stolen<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The exact number cannot be easily found by browsing the Internet or collecting statistics. Counting at first glance, the most massive hack in BTC history with 850,000 BTC stolen from Mt.Gox, plus BitFinex theft of 120,000 Bitcoins, already makes about a million BTC stolen. There are surely more cases, such as Bitstamp and BitFloor hacks, with 19,000 and 25,000 Bitcoins stolen, respectively. So, the final number is likely to be more than 1,000,000 stolen BTC. However, let us not forget, that stolen does not mean gone entirely, and the hacked Bitcoins might still be normally circulating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-many-bitcoin-millionaires-are-there\">How Many Bitcoin Millionaires are there<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With all the BTC anonymity that its supporters adore, it is hard to estimate the exact amount of Bitcoin millionaires. Taking into account current Bitcoin&#8217;s rates, one needs 123.35 BTC to be a dollar millionaire. The amount of currently circulating Bitcoins is 18,158,625 BTC, so, without paying attention to lost and stolen coins, there might be only 147,208 millionaires. As for reality, the figures are smaller, and there are only 50,000 Bitcoin millionaires in the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-many-bitcoin-billionaires-are-there\">How Many Bitcoin Billionaires are there<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the current Bitcoin rates (around $8,100), there are no Bitcoin billionaires in the world, except Satoshi, of course. The Winklevoss brothers were BTC billionaires when Bitcoin cost more than $10,000. As for now, their 100,000 coins are not enough to grab the honorable title.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-many-people-mine-bitcoin\">How Many People Mine Bitcoin?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to estimations carried out by one mining pool, 200,000 miners make about 12% of the global network hash rate. If the numbers are close to reality, there are more than 1,500,000 people worldwide who actively mine Bitcoins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-will-happen-when-the-last-btc-is-mined\">What Will Happen When the Last BTC Is Mined?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from traditional block rewards, there are also transaction fees that are added to the blocks and gifted to the successful miners as a bonus. In 2140, when it is estimated that the last Bitcoin will be mined, there will not be a reward for a found block anymore. The miners will only be rewarded with the&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/network-fees\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">transaction fees<\/a>. The fee is small, but no one knows how much BTC itself will cost 120 years later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"when-bitcoin-mining-reward-will-be-halved-again\">When Bitcoin Mining Reward Will Be Halved Again?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The current BTC mining reward is 12.5 Bitcoins, and, as you probably know, it&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/bitcoin-halving-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">halves<\/a>&nbsp;every 210,000 blocks. It has been 50 BTC before, it also has been 25 BTC, and in the nearest future, it will drop to the 6,5 level. There are only about 17,000 blocks, and 216,000 BTC left to mine before miners will start receiving half of the current reward per each block.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-many-bitcoin-forks-and-clones-are-there\">How Many Bitcoin Forks and Clones Are There?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are numerous projects that, to some degree, use BTC technologies or are just its forks. Officially, there are 105&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/bitcoin-forks-history\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bitcoin forks<\/a>&nbsp;now, and dozens of more coins use BTC source code as their foundation. The most famous Bitcoin clone is Litecoin, with its army of supporters and only minor changes compared to the BTC father. As for the most influential fork, the title undoubtedly goes to Bitcoin Cash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-number-of-litecoins-and-bitcoin-cash-coins-that-currently-exist\">What Is the Number of Litecoins and Bitcoin Cash Coins that Currently Exist?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the moment, more than 61,000,000 Litecoins and more than 18,000,000 Bitcoin Cash coins are circulating worldwide. There are hundreds of projects that use BTC source code, and millions of their currencies are circulating among the users as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"is-bitcoin-similar-to-gold\">Is Bitcoin Similar to Gold?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thousands of people call Bitcoin &#8216;the digital gold&#8217;, and not only the high price is the cause. Actually, another reason is its limited supply that will lead to a BTC deficit in the coming years. If taking a closer look at history, Gold&#8217;s amount has increased by about 2% each year. As for Bitcoin, starting this year, its supply will grow even less than 2% yearly, and after 2024 the growth will be less than 1%. The digital Gold is not just a nickname, and Bitcoin will directly face Gold in the 20s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-ethereum-total-emission\">What is Ethereum total emission?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As for today, the overall amount of circulating ETH is slightly more than 109,000,000 coins. However, the idea, the main goal of Ether and future trends here are quite different from Bitcoin, so it is not right to compare the figures directly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-much-time-is-needed-to-get-a-btc\">How Much Time Is Needed to Get a BTC?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One block is found every 10 minutes or so, but it does not mean you will get a reward every time. The real amount of Bitcoin, a miner, gets depends on&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/how-to-mine-bitcoins\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">various factors<\/a>. The most important thing here is the mining power, i.e., the hash rate of your equipment for BTC mining.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"who-has-the-most-bitcoin-savings\">Who has the most Bitcoin savings?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to various sources, Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin founder, has an enormous amount of Bitcoin in his digital pockets. As mentioned before, he likely has somewhere around 700,000 Bitcoins.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Have you ever thought, what will happen the day when the last Bitcoin will be mined?
