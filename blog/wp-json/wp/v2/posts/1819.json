The circulating supply is 66,682,072,191 TRX.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite having entered the crypto market quite recently, TRX has attracted a lot of attention and quickly entered the Top-10 cryptocurrencies list. Currently, having a total market capitalization of $975 million, it is ranked 11th most popular digital asset. Having hit an all-time high price of $0,300363 in (unsurprisingly) January 2018, two years later, a Tronix token is worth $0,013441. The estimated ROI (return on investment) of TRX is 555,27%, which means that $100 worth of TRX bought at the time of the TRON launch would yield $555 today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The token was launched in September 2017 at a $0.01 price; due to an extensive PR campaign and an overall bullish trend on the market at the time, the price began to rise almost immediately and reached its all-time high in just four months. That was when TRX broke into the Top-10 cryptocurrency list, surpassing Litecoin, Stellar, and NEO. However, in mid-January, the price crashed back to $0.04. At that time, the TRON developers were accused of unauthorized sale of 6 billion TRX tokens ($300 worth at the time) on Binance. Investors blamed Justin Sun, the CEO, but he denied the accusations. The trust in the network has not fully recovered since then, but the rapid decrease in price stopped.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of now, price predictions for TRON are among the most positive on the market. Even though it is always hard to predict the price of a given cryptocurrency, the rate of TRX adoption is generally proportional to an increase in its price. Some of the most prominent Asian businessmen &#8211; Tang Binseng of Clash of Kings, Dai Wei of OFO, and Yin Mingshan of Lifan &#8211; keep investing in TRON, being confident about its growth potential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is relatively safe to predict that TRX doubles in size ($0.03) in 2020, a more optimistic forecast from Wall Street expects its price to reach up as high as $40 by the end of 2020.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-tron-nbsp\">What is TRON?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/tron-wallet\">Tronix (TRX)<\/a> is a cryptocurrency associated with the TRON blockchain &#8211; one of the fastest and largest blockchain systems, founded by Justin Sun in 2017 and maintained by th\u0443 TRON Foundation. The concept behind TRON is to provide a decentralized data distribution platform for digital entertainment. Tron is seen as a fast, secure, and censorship-free alternative to current digital content platforms such as Youtube or iTunes, which are thought to have too much control over the content creators and developers who work for it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tronix token (TRX) is used to power the network and serves as an encouragement tool for content creators. A concept behind it is to provide the participants with a reasonable and fair distribution of income, which is generated by the content of the platform itself. Notably, TRX is capable of handling 2000 transactions per second (compare it to Bitcoin&#8217;s seven or Ethereum&#8217;s 15). The specificity of the concept behind TRON makes it a direct competitor of Ethereum, EOS, and NEO.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>TRON combines features of a blockchain and a peer-to-peer network with the aim of bridging the gap between content creators and consumers, thus eliminating the need for a middle-man. A win-win situation is created because of the reduction of costs for the consumer, and a direct receipt of funds by the creator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a data distribution platform, TRON enables unlimited and free release and distribution of digital content such as text, images, audio, and video. While replicating an established business model (think of Netflix, for example), TRON operates on a public blockchain. Being a distributed and decentralized storage platform it makes the process more reliable, cost-efficient, and liberal. A noble goal of TRON is to disrupt the dominance of a few powerful corporations that control the media environment on the Internet. &nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/tron-price-prediction\">Read More&#8230;<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"tron-trx-wallet\">TRON (TRX) Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your crypto wisely!
