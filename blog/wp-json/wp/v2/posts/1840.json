The circulating supply is 20,054,779,554 XLM. The daily trading volume is around $171,723,591.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-time high of Stellar, $0.938144, was reached on January 4, 2018. On the other hand, the all-time low of Stellar, $0.001227, occurred way back on November 18, 2014. Currently, the estimated ROI (return on investment) of XLM is 1,461.39%, which means that $100 worth of XLM bought at the time of the Tether launch would yield around $1,461 of profit today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having started back in 2014 at 0.2 cents per XLM, the price had stayed around the same level for almost three years, with sporadic peaks related to moderate investments. The first major spike in price occurred in May 2017, when the value of a single XLM came close to 5 cents per coin. This was a 25-fold increase compared to the previous years.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In line with the majority of the market, the bullish trend started to take over Stellar in November 2017. The steady growth led to a historical high of XLM at 93 cents per coin in January 2018, after which the price started to decline slowly. A series of regulations, together with other factors, led to a decline and a following stagnation of the whole crypto-market. It is worth mentioning that the coin did not just enter a depression: throughout 2018, several peaks still brightened the price graph, but the downtrend was still obvious.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, 2019 was not as eventful for Stellar in terms of price dynamics. Around May, news came through that Wirex, an FCA-regulated payment platform based in the UK, was about to create 26 stable coins on Stellar blockchain, which brought some hype to the currency. Just as many other coins on the market, XLM experienced moderate growth in the middle of the year, but it leveled out by the end of the year, coming back to the values of the beginning of the year (even somewhat lower).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In spite of the bearish trend that has dominated XLM dynamics over the year, now might be a good time to consider the coin for investments. After all, the trend has dominated the whole cryptocurrency market, but some major events like Bitcoin halving are very likely to change the situation for the better. On a smaller scale, continuous development, brilliant technology, and emerging partnerships may all contribute to an increase in the price of XLM.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stellar&#8217;s enterprise-friendliness is considered the most crucial factor in positive predictions for its price. It is already incorporated or mulling partnerships with companies like Microsoft, IBM, and Wirex. A brilliant project team under the leadership of Jed McCaleb is another reason to believe that the XLM price may rise in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the positive forecasts predict the increase in the XLM value up to $1 in 2020 and even $3-5 by 2025. <a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/stellar-price-prediction\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-stellar-xlm\">What is Stellar (XLM)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stellar is an open-source, blockchain-based distributed ledger system that connects payment systems, banks, and individuals to facilitate the low-cost transfer of value across multiple assets. The native cryptocurrency of Stellar is called lumens (XLM).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded in 2014 by Jed McCaleb, co-creator of Ripple, it was designed as a global blockchain-based financial network with decreased transaction costs and time lags. The fixed transaction mining fee is 0.00001 lumens (XLM). The primary focus of Stellar is on the part of the world population that still does not have access to conventional banking services. Upon launch, Stellar received donations from organizations as prominent as Google.org, FastForward, and BlackRock.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stellar is a hard fork of Bitcoin. A distinct feature of Stellar is a dedicated consensus mechanism called the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), in which a selected number of trusted nodes performs transaction authentication. Stellar offers distributed exchange, automatically performing currency conversions at the best available rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stellar is already incorporated in several businesses, such as Parkway Projects and Deloitte. It is specifically the enterprise-friendliness of the coin that is thought to be a driver of positive expert forecasts for XLM.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"stellar-wallet\">Stellar Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your crypto wisely!
