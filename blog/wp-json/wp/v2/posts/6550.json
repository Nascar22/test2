That\u2019s why it is very difficult to make a long-term forecast for any cryptocurrency.&nbsp; In particular, this applies to Monero.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bets let\u2019s take a look at some of the top XMR price predictions for next year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"trading-beasts-monero-price-prediction-2020\">Trading Beasts Monero Price Prediction 2020<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This prediction portal from this invest blog displays a decline in Monero value until October 2020.

But the coin value will fluctuate sharply. The XMR price can roughly be up to $64.25 by the end of 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"longforecast-monero-price-prediction-2020\">LongForecast Monero Price Prediction 2020<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to this crypto website, the Monero will be <a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/monero-wallet\">profitable <\/a>next year.

They set up their XMR price prediction at the $150 level by 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"480\"  height=\"480\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Monero XMR Price Prediction\"  class=\"wp-image-6554 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/giphy-1.gif\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"monero-xmr-price-chart-2\">Monero (XMR) Price Chart<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"monero-price-prediction-2020\">Monero Price Prediction 2020<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Monero has testified a discouraging year during as the altcoin fell by a total of 49% facing BTC from the beginning of 2019 and is only up by a total of 10% against the USD. XMR trades at around $55 (as of the time of article writing) and looks to be going farther lower if things proceed in the same way.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, experts consider that XMR has a very big future ahead of itself. As our privacy remains to consume on the Internet, privacy-preserving plans such as Monero will proceed to enjoy the attention as users look for other methods to hold their on-goings private.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, this coin has scheduled development inclines that will take the secrecy and security of the network to the next level &#8211; and when these upgrades are performed, Monero will proceed to reign above its game.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For these reasons, experts strongly believe that Monero has the substantial potential of rising by 172%. This is a pretty conventional judgment because if the added privacy highlights are integrated, XMR could easily get much higher and test the $200 level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"monero-price-forecast\">Monero Price Forecast<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also an estimation of one of the most famous crypto specialists \u2014 John McAfee. His observations about the cryptocurrency market will have a direct influence on altcoin&#8217;s value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While John McAfee has not given a demanding Monero price prediction, he has said that XMR has a positive forecast. Besides, this coin will challenge BTC as the main altcoin. He has been very vociferous about his support for Monero in discussions and on social media.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like other price forecasts, this one may or may not go into force. But this prediction shows us traders&#8217; confidence in the Monero\u2019s rising.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that\u2019s the overall picture of Monero value forecasts. So, this cryptocurrency may well be a good investment. However, many things could change the price for next year. Eventually, there are a few months until 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"monero-price-prediction-verdict\">Monero Price Prediction Verdict<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The comedown of altcoins that were mainstream favorites at the start of 2019, with XMR amongst them, can be partially associated with amateur investors getting frightened once the bear market kicked in with retribution. Every revival of BTC was met with the huge inefficiency of cryptocurrencies to gather with it. The cause for that can be new investors acquiring from their slips, while coins that were earlier viewing from the sidelines has begun to enter into BTC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These objects weren\u2019t about to buy Bitcoin when it brings a big profit, but newcomers will take a look now, having passed up a chance for the first time. None of the rookie investors are interested in altcoins. However many of them are trading at a huge discount. Institutional investors may be unadventurous, but they\u2019re not silly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some cryptocurrencies will save their speculative price for the near future. But just like the now-infamous tulips, the madness will ultimately recede. The first phases of that slide are already witnessing and most of the altcoins holders will respond sensitively to reports that reprimand their tokens. But a huge amount of experts just observe the altcoins progress. There is no reason to start emotionally withdrawing yourself from cryptocurrencies because it is at a standstill. Moreover, any ideas are useless without performance and real users that consider the altcoin&#8217;s price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-monero-xmr\">What is Monero (XMR)?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Monero is a trending digital cryptocurrency, which built using blockchain technology. XMR can be a useful payment method, like Bitcoin. But there are some differences between these two coins.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, XMR doesn\u2019t use BTC\u2019s technology. Besides, the main focus of this altcoin is improving the user\u2019s data privacy. When the coin owner sends some amount of coins to someone, everyone can see the sender\u2019s name. Furthermore, the name of the recipient will also be known.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, everyone can see the address of the Bitcoin wallet. This is a serious argument against using this cryptocurrency.&nbsp; What&#8217;s more, other users can easily see the list of past transactions in which a specific Bitcoin was used.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides, one of the participants in the exchange may suspect that a particular coin was previously illegally transferred. In this case, he has the right to refuse the transaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monero usage pattern is very different from the \u201cdigital gold\u201d. After the XMR transaction ends, the character of the sender and receiver remains private. Moreover, Monero transactions cannot be connected to each other.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each XMR transaction is private, unlinkable and untraceable, similar to the real amount of cash. Now, let\u2019s see how Monero has performed truly since its birth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"monero-news-network-community-presented-a-new-upgrade\">Monero News: Network community presented a new upgrade<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The XMR team released some news about mining algorithm improvement. The new system called Random X, which intends to be ASIC-resistant. The Monero network workgroup presented new improvement during a live-stream on YouTube. Released a new PoW algorithm based on random code execution. It combines with unique memory-focussed techniques. A new algorithm will be resistant to all types of devices, which are optimized for professional mining operations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This improvement is also allegedly optimized for general-purpose CPU to make the network more decentralized. Consequently, those people who want to use GPU to mine XMR need to consider that it will be more complicated to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Monero workgroup maintains that application-specific integrated circuit devices are in a stable position as there are only several corporations in the world that can produce them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, other experts have declared the definite opposite. A BitTorrent protocol founder Bran Cohen stated that a new ASIC-resistant algorithm is both an impossible dream and a wrong idea. He appended that there will be much better to be friendly for ASIC. He believes that resistance makes production more centralized.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, there is an interesting opinion by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. He repeated similar viewpoints when he stated that there is a living agreement that ASIC-resistant systems ephemeral existence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-choose-monero-wallet\">How To Choose Monero Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your keys to access the wallet remain encrypted in your device.
