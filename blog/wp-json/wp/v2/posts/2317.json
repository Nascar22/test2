The circulating supply is 694,191,974 XTZ. The daily trading volume is around $42,587,202.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-time high of Tezos, $10.00, was reached in December 2017. The estimated ROI (return on investment) of XTZ is 197.20%, which means that $100 worth of XTZ bought at the time of the Tezos launch would yield about $197 today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tezos is one of the top cryptocurrencies known for stably keeping to a bullish trend relative to the rest of the market. However, the signs of short-term exhaustion prevalent in its recent price history shall be taken into account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in April 2017, in Switzerland, the Tezos Foundation was founded, followed by an ICO (initial coin offering) in July. The XTZ tokens were sold at $0.47 each. As a result of the ICO, 65,000 BTC and 325,000 ETH were raised, which was equal to $232 million at the time, making it one of the most successful initial coin offerings by 2017.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right after the ICO, an argument sparked between the president of the Tezos Foundation Johann Gevers, and Kathleen Breitman and Arthur Breitman, the creators of Tezos, postponed the development by several months. Moreover, in October 2017, a lawsuit was registered against Tezos in California, citing &#8220;violation of the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, as well as state false advertising, and unfair competition laws.&#8221; Because of that, the Genesis block was only mined in June 2018. Six hundred eight million XTZ were created without a limit on the total XTZ supply.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>XTZ is currently not listed on some of the main exchanges, such as Binance, Bittrex, Gemini, and Poloniex. In mid-December, XTZ hit $1.72, which became its highest value since August 2018. It looks like Tezos is about to hit new heights. For instance, the last major peak occurred in August 2018, when XTZ was listed on Coinbase. Not long ago, Binance added Tezos to their Trust Wallet, which is a big step forward for the coin and was a good indication for an upcoming listing on the exchange. And indeed, in December 2019, XTZ got listed on Binance, which is probably a major contributor to a lot of attention and, accordingly, a spike in its price. The price grew by almost a dollar since October, which can probably be considered a steady upside trend.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The combination of the increased gas limits, staking deposit decrease, and the first community-driven development proposal has recently brought Tezos coin price up. The coin price shows positive dynamics even when the rest of the crypto market experiences a period of stagnation. This behavior, together with the high rate of development, may lead to a significant increase in XTZ price, according to the majority of the forecasts. WalletInvestor assumes that a single Tezos (XTZ) token may be worth $7.03 by 2025. <a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/tezos-price-prediction\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-tezos-nbsp\">What is Tezos?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tezos is a blockchain network and a platform for smart contracts, much like Ethereum and several other crypto-projects. The system is linked to a digital token known as Tez or Tezzie (XTZ). Developed in 2014 by Kathleen and Arthur Breitmans, the Tezos project raised $230,000,000 in ICO, making it one of the most fruitful fundraising campaigns in the history of crypto.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several technical characteristics make Tezos stand out from a vast number of competitors: the tokens are not mined but rather &#8220;baked&#8221; by the members of the network for a reward &#8211; this is known as a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tezos has been called a self-amending cryptographic ledger: the system can modify its own set of rules with little disruption to the network through an on-chain governance model. Tezos is written and operated in a functional programming language OCaml.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite having legal issues shortly after the ICO in 2017, Tezos has been back on track since 2018, striving to catch up with the current dApp platform leaders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"tezos-xtz-wallet\">Tezos (XTZ) Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your crypto wisely!
