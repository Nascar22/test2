In the middle of this year, Siacoin&#8217;s rate was much higher \u2014 about $0,004. So, the Siacoin price lost approximately 70% of the maximum value so far.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"market-prediction-for-siacoin-sc-price-2020\">Market Prediction for Siacoin (SC) Price 2020<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to Siacoin, this ticker stands out in the cryptocurrency market because of its essential position. This coin gains its popularity. Therefore, many people have started to talk about future SC values. Let&#8217;s take a look at some market experts or crypto portal sayings:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"trading-beasts-sc-price-prediction\">Trading Beasts SC Price Prediction<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This website sees SC as a potential asset for 2020. It considers that the Siacoin price will increase to $0,002 level. Moreover, SC value can exceed $0,003 mark by the end of 2020.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"gov-capital-sc-price-prediction\">GOV Capital SC Price Prediction<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts from this invest blog believe that a sharp rise will follow the decline in Siacoin value. The future price of this asset is predicted at a $0.01 mark by 2020. Your current investment may be worth three times bigger than now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"crypto-rating-sc-price-prediction\">Crypto-Rating SC Price Prediction<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This prediction portal analyzed the cryptocurrency market. It shows that the Siacoin value will increase to $0.005448 level by 2020. The potential interest from large investors will cause it. Moreover, there is possibly more regulation expected in the crypto field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"digitalcoinprice-sc-price-prediction\">DigitalCoinPrice SC Price Prediction<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts from this cryptocurrency website consider that the Siacoin will be a profitable investment. Their forecast is very positive. Due to DigitalCoinPrice information, the SC price will increase to $0,003 level by the end of 2020. It&#8217;s 2x nearly from the Siacoin current price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"wallet-investor-sc-price-prediction\">Wallet Investor SC Price Prediction<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to their analysis, the Siacoin price will come down. The SC value will decrease to $0,0001 mark by the end of 2020. Traders believe that Siacoin will be a high-risk investment option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"siacoin-price-prediction-2020\">Siacoin Price Prediction 2020<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Next year will hold many collaborations and for Sia Network. Therefore, it will start positively. Due to some forecasts, SC price will reach $0.038 by the first quarter of 2020. It will be stable until the first half of the year, after which it will likely be up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, Sia&#8217;s plan of action says that the network makers aim to compete with a massive market player \u2014 Amazon S3.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides, the usage rates and storage capacity will increase cardinally. It comes as the current Siacoin price becomes much more significant. Due to the last information, its level is almost as massive as 4.5 petabytes. And it will likely increase as knowing about Siacoin will grow up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This fact shows the SC potential in 2020. It will not let it come down. Moreover, it will be having a benefit to other tickers. It caused by its unique functionality and extensive distribution.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"siacoin-price-forecast\">Siacoin Price Forecast<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Two years ago, dark clouds became gathering over ticker&#8217;s destiny. Patrick Brik from Profit Confidential wrote in November 2017 that the Siacoin has no future. But this mention on the ticker could easily be nonsense since he doesn&#8217;t even seem to grasp how to market capitalizations work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Brick emphasized the small ticker price. He said he&#8217;s &#8216;missing something&#8217; in this case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, as mentioned before, this opinion demonstrates the unprofessional character of the trader. The price being a fraction of a cent is a single SC coin value. But anyone wants to buy one ticker. Investors put more significant amounts of money instead. Investments run into thousands of dollars. So, it&#8217;s not a secret that he doesn&#8217;t have the faintest idea about the need for a secure storage solution for investment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides, here is another exciting part of this prediction. Patrick Brik believes that altcoins are in a bubble. Moreover, he thinks that most cryptocurrencies will bring about the collapse.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides, this man likes to crow about some technical things in his article. But it has nothing to do with long-term severe Siacoin price prediction.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He concludes he talks about some technical details. In his discussion, he referred to the previous SC value trends. But he didn&#8217;t say anything about file storage development. It wasn&#8217;t worth taking into his article.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"siacoin-price-prediction-verdict\">Siacoin Price Prediction Verdict<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s tough to give a clear idea of Siacoin as a good investment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the one side, it is a good-working product which is deservedly competing with other existing services in the same field. On the other hand, there is a lot of different services which offer the same set of functions. Some of them have been identified as the world&#8217;s biggest companies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at the existing roadmap, it seems that Sia plans to make SC a strong competitor to Amazon and Google. But there&#8217;s plenty of ways nuanced. If the market will decide to work with the game changers, or the planet&#8217;s officials will amend the financial management system, the prospect for Siacoin is less favorable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, SC is a high-risk investment. You shouldn&#8217;t use more money than you can allow you to lose. If Siacoin&#8217;s price will come down to $0.00 level, would it differentially impact the quality of your life? If your answer is &#8220;yes&#8221;, you&#8217;ve given the shirt off your back!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"siacoin-news-sia-network-makers-obtained-a-settlement\">Siacoin News: Sia network makers obtained a settlement<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier, creators of the Sia storage network agreed with U. S. officials on a scheme for the placement and conversion of unregistered securities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a blog post, the company announced a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Sia will pay compensation for $120,000, a prepayment of interest of $24,602, and a fine of $80,000. During the sale of the Siacoin ticker in 2014, Nebulous raised about $120,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The settlement of Sia comes a day after the announcement of the block. Agreement for $24 million with the Securities and Exchange Commission is followed by the sale of EOS securities for $4.1 billion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the Nebulous agreement, the company is not required to register the Siacoin service token as a security. Siacoins are used in the Sia ecosystem to buy and sell cloud storage and pay off profits to Siafund investors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Nebulous legal representatives at Cooley LLP, the network is used by 323 hosts in 43 different countries to store file contracts containing more than 500 terabytes of data. For the record, one terabyte worth 500 hundred hours of HD-quality video, or 8 iPhone 11 Pro 128GB.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nebulous COO Zach Herbert told CoinDesk that the company is excited that the SEC has decided not to take any action against the Siacoins, although the penalty for our 2014 unregistered Siafunds offers very high. Besides, the Board of Directors believes that this calculation confirms the correctness of the two-component Siacoin model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-siacoin-sc\">What is Siacoin (SC)?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Siacoin is a cloud storage platform, which based on a blockchain and has no data center. It splits apart, encrypt, and distributes information across their extensive network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Siacoin is a fully private ticker. It means that no one&#8217;s computer has an entire data \u2014 all the files copied on thousands of devices. If a hard drive fails, your&#8217;s information won&#8217;t be lost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, the Sia network extends transactions to create new storage contracts. After forming an agreement, a storage host agrees to keep a client&#8217;s information safe. Moreover, it needs to periodically submit proof of their continued storage unless the contract expires. Then, the provider gives compensation for every evidence they provide and penalized for missing evidence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since all collected proofs became publicly available in the blockchain, network consensus can be used to enforce storage contracts automatically. It means that clients don&#8217;t need to make a verification of their storage proofs. They can upload their data and give a permit to the network for remaining it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-choose-siacoin-wallet\">How To Choose Siacoin Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your keys to access the wallet remain encrypted in your device.
