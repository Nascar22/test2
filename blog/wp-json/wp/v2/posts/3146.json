The circulating supply is 233,753,799,745 NPXS, while the total supply is 258,599,580,301 NPXS. The daily trading volume is around $677,312 or 85.73726401 BTC. The most active exchange that trades NPXS is Binance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-time high of Pundi X, $0.015621, was reached on June 17, 2018 &#8211; outside the most famous cryptocurrency bull-run of Winter 2017-2018. On the other hand, the all-time low of NPXS, $0.000120, occurred fairly recently on January 10, 2020. Currently, the estimated ROI (return on investment) of Pundi X is -87.90%, which means that $100 worth of NPXS bought at the time of the Pundi X launch would not yield any profit today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In March 2018, when Pundi X first appeared on the cryptocurrency market, it only cost $0.001. The price had not changed much until May when the token was listed on Binance, and the price of NPXS soared to $0.012; the market capitalization reached $360 million. The reason for the listing of NPXS was the active support of the community. Following the community vote, Binance supported Pundi X for free. Around that time, NPXS reached its historical high of $0.015621.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The peak did not last long, however, and a downtrend, which is still relevant today, took over the coin dynamics. By Autumn 2018, NPXS went back to the initial price of $0.001 and continued to fall from then on. By December, the token cost only $0.005, and the market capitalization went down to $83 million. Only in February did the picture brighten up, albeit briefly: the price went back to the level of $0.007. In May, for the first time in a while, the price of NPXS exceeded the initial level with $0.0011 per token; the market capitalization rose back to $200 million, accordingly. Ever since then, the coin has experienced a strong downtrend.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>NPXS is listed on several major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, Bithumb, and Huobi, which provides substantial liquidity for the token. More than 5,000 XPOS payment terminals have been installed in retail stores; those accept payments simply with a QR code. By February 2021, a minimum of 100,000 terminals shall be installed in several countries. One of the most prominent recent partnerships of Pundi X is with Traki, the largest retail chain in Venezuela. In addition, the company is soon planning to enter the United Emirates market. Pundi X has recently received a registration certificate for communication systems from the UE &#8211; an essential step for the full implementation of Pundi X POS terminals in the country.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the coin has been stagnating pretty much all the time since April 2018. A possible reason for that is that NPXS is a utility token, meaning it only has inherent value within the platform itself. Another potential drawback is the developers&#8217; focus on the markets of Indonesia, Singapore, and the United Emirates rather than the global market.
