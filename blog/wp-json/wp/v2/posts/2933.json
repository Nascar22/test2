The main goal of the project is to create a decentralized, open and transparent environment for all the institutions involved in the global financial industry. The idea is to solve the fundamental issue of coordination between intermediaries: OmiseGo aims at bringing transactions to peer-to-peer format, cut the fees and improve the speed and convenience. The intent is to get rid of numerous intermediaries like banks and create a system that connects people all over the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OmiseGo is fueled by its native ERC20-based token called OMG. It works on the Proof-of-Stake (or PoS) consensus algorithm. OMG is the main asset of the system that the project is building.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OmiseGo also features its cross-chain decentralized exchange called ODEX. It is the infrastructure designed to connect different markets and provide seamless cryptocurrency trading without leaving the OmiseGo\u2019s blockchain. OMG and modified PoS algorithm serve to fulfill the correct work of this technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since OmiseGo is based on the Ethereum\u2019s platform, it uses its native blockchain scalability system called Plasma. It is a feature that serves as a solution for dealing with high loads and market activity inside the blockchain by providing a theoretically infinite amount of supply. In fact, the PoS consensus is tailored to Plasma which works as a framework between the Ethereum root chain and the OmiseGo child chain. To make it more clear let\u2019s say that Plasma is an add-on that allows building service on the Ethereum\u2019s platform with implementing some unique features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team behind this service is Omise \u2014 a payment platform from Southeast Asia. The company itself was founded in 2013 and then created OmiseGo as an independent subsidiary project. The OMG\u2019s ICO sale was held in July 2017 and raised $25 million. As of this article making at the end of 2019, OMG token is listed on a lot of different exchanges including major ones like ZB.com, OKEx, CoinBit, Huobi, HitBTC, and Binance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"omise-go-wallet\">Omise Go Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your crypto wisely!
