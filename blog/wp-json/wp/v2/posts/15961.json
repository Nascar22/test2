The circulating supply is 1,220,085 ACOIN, while there is no data on the total or maximum supply of ACOIN. There is also no information on the daily trading volume. Acoin is trading on several major markets, yet the most active exchange that trades ACOIN is YoBit.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-time high of Acoin, $1.08, was reached on June 23, 2017 &#8211; outside the most famous cryptocurrency bull-run of Winter 2017-2018. On the other hand, the all-time low of ACOIN, $0.000683, occurred way back on September 03, 2016. Currently, the estimated ROI (return on investment) of Acoin is -61.49%, which means that $100 worth of ACOIN bought at the time of the Acoin launch would not yield any profit today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most recent price trend of Acoin appears to be readily positive. While in 24 hours, the price of ACOIN did not rise or fall, the 7-day price dynamics show a 14.65% increase in the price of ACOIN. Nevertheless, the price predictions for Acoin tend to be rather pessimistic. According to WalletInvestor, Acoin is a bad long-term investment. In one year from now, the price of ACOIN may be as low as $0.004069, which is one order of magnitude lower than the current price. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that price manipulations of ACOIN are possible due to the comparatively low market capitalization, so one should be very careful when investing in Acoin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-acoin\">What is Acoin<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ACOIN is a decentralized cryptocurrency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world.
