Litecoin has a different way of transaction and mining as Bitcoin, but its price and growth still depend on its bigger brother.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Litecoin takes fourth place in the top 10 cryptocurrencies in the world, LTC volume in 24 hours is about $ 1 BLN and LTC current price is about 42 USD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"litecoin-ltc-history\">Litecoin (LTC) history<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1375\"  height=\"378\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-14388 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 1375px) 100vw, 1375px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/litecoin-history-price.png\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/litecoin-history-price.png 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/litecoin-history-price.png 1024w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/litecoin-history-price.png 768w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/litecoin-history-price.png 1920w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/litecoin-history-price.png 1536w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/litecoin-history-price.png 2048w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/litecoin-history-price.png 380w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/litecoin-history-price.png 1375w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At the beginning, the way of Litecoin mining was perfectly simple, because the blocks were easier to proceed then the Bitcoin blocks. Home PC was enough for Litecoin mining, these conditions were perfect for users, it attracts a lot of interest to Litecoin and at the beginning of 2017 Litecoin was named as digital silver.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"litecoin-ltc-price-today\"><br>Litecoin (LTC) price today<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the falling of all the cryptocurrency Litecoin price is fall too, but a year ago, December 19 Litecoin price has its maximum and LTC price in USD was $ 364. So it seems that Litecoin price lost about 90% of its maximum value, but LTC average price is about $ 125 and at this moment it have a space for growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"price-prediction-2019\"><span id=\"litecoin-ltc-price-prediction\">Litecoin (LTC) price prediction<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Today more than 80% of the Litecoin is already mined and this result was reached at rather short times and market capitalization in those times was even more than $ 10 BLN. Mining becomes more complicated and it seems like it will be a long time until the rest of the LTC will be mined, so Litecoin is not dead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With increasing of the coins amount, Litecoin has even more possibilities for the capitalization and LTC price has a potential. When the Litecoin was just released, it was added to some of the exchange services and its price went up so fast, no one expected. The speed of transactions, the already built-in SegWit, and the larger reward for mining indicate bright prospects for the LTC price. Litecoin price could possibly be a rival for the Ethereum in 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you looking for Litecoin news there you can find the experts predict a potential convergence of ETH and LTC prices courses notwithstanding the ETH overtakes LTC at a cost of more than 5 times. A number of crypto enthusiasts suggest that the difference in ETH and LTC prices in 2019 will be no more than 3 times. Perspectives for the further development of LTC are based on the following characteristics of the coin:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>High transaction speed;<\/li><li>A built-in protocol that increases the plasticity of the system and the speed of operations;<\/li><li>A large amount of reward for cloud mining.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"market-prediction-2019\"><span id=\"market-prediction-for-litecoin-ltc-price\">Market prediction for Litecoin (LTC) price<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sam Quinn, the author of the online publication with a focus on Ethereum analysis, said that he didn&#8217;t believe in serious competition between LTC and ETH. Mr. Quinn calls the state in which the crypto sphere is located is &#8220;infancy&#8221;. He draws an analogy with children&#8217;s cries \u2013 when &#8220;baby&#8221; cries louder, that attracts the primary attention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Litecoin is still a quieter &#8220;child&#8221;, but it has a chance to start early rapid growth. For this reason, LTC price in 2019 can behave unpredictably. In addition, in the last couple of years, the crypto has behaved positively, except for the depreciation of the course in January 2018.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, around the Litecoin news were versions of the price of Litecoin for 2019 in the range of 350-500 USD for 1 LTC. However, there are those who predict the loss of Litecoin popularity, which ultimately will lead to a fall in Litecoin volume and finally drop the Litecoin price for this reason.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Economic Forecasting Agency analyzes not only real money but also cryptocurrencies. Specialists in this company suggest that there should be no surprising jumps in the Litecoin price in 2019. Moreover, the LTC price will fluctuate throughout the year, constantly rising and falling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"verdict\"><span id=\"litecoin-price-prediction-verdict\">Litecoin price prediction verdict<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Litecoin price grew in 2013, then fell down, and then in 2017 started to grow again with the high speed, so LTC is one of \u201cunexpected\u201d cryptos. Some experts hypothesize that the popularity of this coin will come to naught, which in turn will lead to the collapse of the Litecoin price and the exit of Litecoin from the market. But despite all the arguments against of Litecoin, its price may be between $ 200-400, because LTC price still didn\u2019t reach $ 80-100 and could possibly grow up in 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-choose-litecoin-ltc-wallet\">How to choose Litecoin (LTC) wallet<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-14376 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/mainnotebook-1-1676x1080.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To store your funds you need to have&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/litecoin-wallet\">non-custodial Litecoin wallet<\/a>&nbsp;Atomic Wallet it&#8217;s just such a wallet, your Private keys are stored on your device and never leave it, so you money is totally under your control.
