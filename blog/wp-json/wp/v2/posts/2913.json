Bitcoin SV is a project led by Craig Wright&#8217;s team with the main idea to increase the block size from 32 to 128 Mb to scalable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current price of Bitcoin SV fluctuates around $114.15; the total market capitalization is $2,062,430,041 or 260,691 BTC, which makes Bitcoin SV one of the ten most popular digital currencies as of January 2020. The circulating supply is 18,068,415 BSV, while the maximum supply is 21,000,000 BSV. The daily trading volume is around $753,817,627 or 95,207 BTC. The most active exchange that trades BSV is ZBG.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-time high of Bitcoin SV, $255.88, was reached on June 22, 2019 &#8211; outside the most famous cryptocurrency bull-run of Winter 2017-2018. On the other hand, the all-time low of BSV, $36.87, occurred way back on November 23, 2018. Currently, the estimated ROI (return on investment) of Bitcoin SV is 25.95%, which means that $100 worth of BSV bought at the time of the Bitcoin SV launch would yield around $26 of profit today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In November 2018, when Bitcoin SV just entered the cryptocurrency market, the price of a single BSV was equal to $88. It only took several days for the price to double, and after a week of trading, the price reached $240. Several factors contributed to such a crazy leap. The fact that BSV is related to Bitcoin was a sufficient prerequisite for the coin to start trading on major exchanges from the first days of its existence. Much for the same reason, the investors&#8217; attention immediately was attracted to the new coin.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, by the end of the month, the price dropped all the way down to $37. At the time, Bitcoin SV was experiencing multiple technical problems: for instance, many users could not withdraw BSV from Poloniex, one of the major cryptocurrency exchanges.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second growth phase started in December, when the price soared to $100, bringing the market capitalization to $2 billion. What followed afterward was a 6-month long stagnation period at the level just under the initial price. Another sharp peak brightened the price chart in June 2019, when the price exceeded a $200 mark. After a dynamic summer with multiple price fluctuations, BSV has been on a downtrend again, with the price still keeping above the initial $88.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the price forecast, the experts from WalletInvestor are positive about the future of BSV, predicting an increase in price up to $190 in 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-bitcoin-sv-bsv\">What is Bitcoin SV (BSV)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin SV, BSV (short for Satoshi Vision), is an altcoin that was launched as a result of the Bitcoin Cash hard fork that took place on November 15, 2018. Another altcoin that emerged as a result of the split is the original Bitcoin Cash or BCH ABC. Initially, BSV was presented as the new Bitcoin at the same time as Craig Wright proclaimed himself the real Satoshi Nakamoto. BCH ABC, on the other hand, remained the classic Bitcoin Cash fork led by the former leader Roger Ver.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary cause of the split was dissatisfaction with the upcoming updates for the codebase proposed by Amaury Sechet, the lead developer. Craig Wright, who currently leads the Bitcoin SV team, and his supporters believed that the update would not solve the issue of scalability of BCH. Besides that, the focus of the development team now includes increasing the level of security, lowering the transaction fees, and providing more convenience for miners and institutional investors.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the split, the two forks chose different development paths. Bitcoin Cash ABC decided to incorporate dApps (decentralized applications) and cross-chain transactions into the blockchain. Bitcoin SV, on the other hand, focused on scalability by increasing transaction speed. Both blockchains are still running on the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanisms and have not yet announced plans to switch to the popular Proof-of-Stake (PoS) alternative.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the name suggests, the main idea of Bitcoin SV is to keep up with the original ideas of Bitcoin development proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as we know it, a decade ago. Having appeared as one of the most scandalous hard forks in the history of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin SV experienced tremendous growth right in the first weeks of trading, entering the Top-10 cryptocurrency list by market capitalization. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On 15 November 2018, the Bitcoin Cach (BCH) had a hard fork; the main BCH chain split into Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV (Satoshi Vision).
