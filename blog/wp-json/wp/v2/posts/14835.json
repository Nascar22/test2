The circulating supply is 254,381,801 THC, while the total supply is 254,516,951 THC. The daily trading volume is around $33.67 or 0.00389426 BTC. HempCoin is trading on several major markets, yet the most active exchange that trades THC is Graviex.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-time high of HempCoin, $0.743657, was reached on Jan 11, 2018 &#8211; during the most famous cryptocurrency bull-run of Winter 2017-2018. On the other hand, the all-time low of THC, $0.000012, occurred way back on Oct 01, 2015. Currently, the estimated ROI (return on investment) of HempCoin is 904.98%, which means that $100 worth of THC bought at the time of the HempCoin launch would yield about $905 of profit today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most recent price trend of HempCoin appears to be readily positive. While in 24 hours, the price of THC rose by 4.84%, the 7-day price dynamics show a 67.10% increase in the price of THC. Nevertheless, the price predictions for HempCoin are usually quite pessimistic. According to WalletInvestor, HempCoin is a bad long-term investment. In one year from now, the price of THC may be as low as $0.000128, which would mean a 10-fold decrease compared to the current price. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that price manipulations of THC are possible due to the extremely low market capitalization, so one should be very careful when investing in HempCoin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-hempcoin-thc\">What is HempCoin (THC)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hempcoin (THC) is a digital currency that is based on Bitcoin but has improved payments and security features. Launched in 2014, the HempCoin (THC) was built on the source code of Komodo (KMD) for the Hemp Industry. As the name suggests, the aim of THC is to help facilitate secure transactional relationships between farmers, distributors, and consumers of hemp. In the second quarter of 2019, THC leveraged the Komodo Platform to build HempTRAC using UTXO.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"HempCoin (THC) price The current price of HempCoin fluctuates around $0.001021; the total market capitalization is $259,670 or&hellip;\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[167],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.4.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Hempcoin Price 2020 | THC Chart | Hempcoin Value<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Get the most accurate info about THC Price, price chart, trade volume, market cap and more.
