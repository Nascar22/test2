Some believe in the recovery of the crypto-assets and the broader usage of blockchain technology; others are more skeptical. However, we barely talk about people who create the crypto world. They determine the development of the industry and predict the crypto future. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the most influential people in crypto.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"changpeng-zhao\"><span id=\"1-changpeng-zhao-ceo-and-founder-of-binance\">1.\tChangpeng Zhao, CEO and founder of Binance<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow Twitter:&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cz_binance\">@cz_binance<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Changpeng Zhao, goes by CZ, started his career working service jobs, including McDonald&#8217;s and a gas station. Later, he managed to get a job at the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where he developed software for matching trade orders. After, he worked at Bloomberg Tradebook developing futures trading software.

Since then, it is the primary vector of Mr. Zhao.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the priority lines of Binance\u2019s operation is the support of governments with crypto adoption. Moreover, the cryptocurrency exchange follows the law, works with every government, law enforcement agency, and regulatory body. In the case of a criminal case against an exchange user, Binance will give out the client\u2019s information. Such a policy allows the company to grow fast and be one of the leading developers of the crypto industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interesting facts:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The father of Mr. Zhao, who was a professor in China, was labeled &#8220;pro-bourgeois intellect&#8221; and expelled from the country.<\/li><li>At the beginning of the Binance\u2019s path, there was no proper working space.

Currently, Bitmain is considered as the world&#8217;s dominant producer of cryptocurrency mining chips. Jihan Wu is no longer Bitmain\u2019s official legal representative. However, he is still one of the most influential people in the crypto world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, Mr. Wu resigned as co-CEO of Bitmain and founded Matrixport.

However, it\u2019s not the truth. Jack Dorsey is one of the leading Bitcoin enthusiasts. He calls Bitcoin &#8220;the internet&#8217;s first native currency.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His payment system Square is highly involved in the development of the crypto industry.

At the moment, the project survives hard times with a lack of trust in Facebook due to several scandals. Facebook created the Libra Association with such giants as Uber, Paypal, and Mastercard. However, it hasn\u2019t helped much.
