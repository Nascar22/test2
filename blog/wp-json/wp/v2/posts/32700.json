With many countries still on full\/ partial lockdowns, the effect of these extended lockdowns would result in a &#8216;hunt for profit,&#8217; which could result in volatile markets like the cryptocurrency market being pumped in a bullish parabolic advance, emerging markets and innovations popping up as well as scams and bubbles.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Unstable global economy:<\/strong>&nbsp;According to Andreas Steno, Chief global FX\/FI strategist of Nordea, more than $3 trillion was created in 2020 alone, meaning that about 20% of all existing supply of the United States Dollar was created in 2020. This increased supply has resulted in a decrease in the value of the US dollar, encouraging investors, financial institutions, and corporate organizations to seek better value elsewhere, especially in metals, stocks, and other nascent technologies like Bitcoin and digital assets. This was seen as positive Dogecoin news and is one of the catalysts for the current crypto bull market. Further unstableness in the global economy could result in a &#8216;never-seen&#8217; parabolic advance in the cryptocurrency markets.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Freedom of money:<\/strong>&nbsp;As people continue losing trust in the traditional financial system, the push for a decentralized system continues with people looking for trustless, immutable, and secure systems to depend on, and the cryptocurrency industry is leading in this regard. The industry could thus see increased volatility in the coming year as more institutions and individuals like Elon Musk, Grayscale and Microstrategy adopt cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DOGECOIN PRICE PREDICTION FOR 2025<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the current parabolic rise of Dogecoin retracing its move, technical analysis suggests that Dogecoin price would see a retracement of about -84.75% to -94.75% before another parabolic move in a few years.

The next parabolic advance would be fueled by massive Dogecoin news of global adoption as the world moves into an era of Blockchain and cryptocurrency dominance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>PREDICTION VERDICT<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With many investors hopeful about Dogecoin and many institutions adopting Dogecoin as a means of payment, Dogecoin&#8217;s USD price looks eager to make a new high in the long run. Should Elon Musk, the world&#8217;s richest man, adopt Dogecoin as a means of payment for&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tesla.com\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tesla<\/a>, we could have another parabolic advance coming for Dogecoin price. In the short term, Dogecoin USD price could witness a few weeks to months of retracement and range before finding strong support. Traders who long and short Dogecoin with leverage would make profits off this retracement, while long term investors who have long term targets just hold DOGE till their targets are hit. In the short term, Dogecoin news of adoption and new developments, which hasn&#8217;t happened for years, could send DOGE price roaring again as the cryptocurrency market remains the most volatile market in the world. With the Dogecoin community growing and becoming stronger, blockchain development may be agreed upon by the community to boost the technology behind Dogecoin and further increase its chances of gaining massive global adoption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DOGE can be a profitable investment option for investors looking to invest in cryptocurrencies\/ digital assets. At the current Dogecoin USD price of 0.03250, a $1,000 fiat purchase is equivalent to 3,250DOGE, and based on the above prediction, a long term increase is expected to happen, with a target price of $0.10. So within five years, a $1,000 investment would be worth over $2,800 with an ROI of about 185%. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>HOW TO EXCHANGE DOGECOIN<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-32900 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/HOW-TO-EXCHANGE-DOGECOIN0A.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Using Atomic wallet&#8217;s multi-purpose feature, you can easily exchange multiple digital assets\/ cryptocurrencies to Dogecoin and also exchange Dogecoin to other cryptocurrencies.
