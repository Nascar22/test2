The coin is distributed by your national telecom operator, and it can be made available to everyone, anywhere, anytime. Mobile network operators are the center of the Telcoin strategy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is the first cryptocurrency to utilize the link between the reach of telecommunications and the borderless and fast nature of blockchain technology. The World Bank estimates that there are over 5 billion mobile phones globally. However, active bank accounts are only 1.2 billion. Telcoin aims to bridge the gap between the availability of banks and the need to store funds.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Telcoin offered the digital asset to its mobile network partners so that they can offer their customers quick and seamless access to the digital economy. Some of the services offered by Telcoin include e-commerce, online remittances, payments, and transfers. Also, it offers product development and marketing resources to boost the Telcoin ecosystem.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The objective of Telcoin is not competing with mobile telecom money but to cooperate and partner with customers in the overall mobile money ecosystem. Telcoin views itself as an alternative or complementary solution to provide users with mobile wallets, mobile money, and cryptocurrency-backed solutions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"history-and-main-features-of-telcoin-tel\">History and Main Features of Telcoin (TEL)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Telcoin was founded in 2017 by Claude Eguienta and Paul Neuner. Claude has a background in computer science and professional expertise in startups and tech companies. His dream was to develop a mobile money solution that would benefit people in developing countries, especially in Africa.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its main feature is that it is compliant with all the necessary guidelines used by mobile operators globally. Due to its objectives of being a complementary solution in the telecom industry, the platform ensured that it is in perfect alignment with international telecom rules and regulations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, Telcoin has partnered with some of the world\u2019s main network providers to develop an infrastructure that can work with and support over 5 billion users. The move has allowed the coin to have good market potential because it has the strengths of a system that is already trusted by users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, the project distributes native tokens to mobile networks through a reward-based model. The model was designed in such a way that every participant in the network can obtain the incentive. Also, Telcoin tokens are shared out at a rate of 5% annually to ensure that it becomes used to the mobile market at large.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"telcoin-tel-price-chart\">Telcoin (TEL) Price Chart<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Telcoin (TEL) Price chart\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/L_ysGA1DTxTBt1BGNsWSTN3_81KfjOoUtWhE5yYgS-7yFeD3Aj4nuc7KpVP_XBwyeovy7hwuWvHhbd8H89z8eyZuOswN7QpPAs2b5PZSUK3ulMwt32y5QPKzKg1uz8VFrrf5dhiEtpRWYyJZjA\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Figure 1 showing the Telcoin Price Chart from December 2018 to December 2019<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"telcoin-tel-price-analysis\">Telcoin (TEL) Price Analysis<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Telcoin price on December 16, 2019, was $0.000382.
