Still, there are differences. Tezos boasts a far more advanced infrastructure. In other words, it doesn&#8217;t require a hard fork or changing the network&#8217;s protocol that makes previously invalid blocks and transactions valid for any upgrade. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum can&#8217;t offer the same to their users.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tezos team held an initial coin offering (ICO) in July 2017, raising the equivalent of $232 million (66,000 BTC and 361,000 ETH), the largest ICO. Following the ICO, the Tezos Foundation, based out of Switzerland, was created to launch the protocol.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tezos blockchain enables many features common to cryptocurrencies. Developers can use its software to run custom programming logic (smart contracts) and design new programs (decentralized applications) to replicate products and services.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tezos can be described as secure, upgradable, and built-to-last. XTZ is an open-source platform that is said to ensure outstanding accuracy due to its smart contracts. Moreover, its staking process involves the community &#8211; people participate in governing the network by &#8220;baking.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Main Features of Tezos (XTZ) includes;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Tezos is a self-amending decentralized platform for building dApps.<\/li><li>Network upgrade doesn&#8217;t require a hard fork, unlike other networks.<\/li><li>Tezos network confirmation is fast and cheap.<\/li><li>It can scale more transactions with smart contract enabled, unlike Ethereum.<\/li><li>&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"tezos-xtz-price-chart\"><strong>Tezos (XTZ) Price Chart:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1348\"  height=\"698\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-34470 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 1348px) 100vw, 1348px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/dev.atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tezos-XTZ-Price-Chart.jpg\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tezos-XTZ-Price-Chart.jpg 1348w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tezos-XTZ-Price-Chart-989x512.jpg 989w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tezos-XTZ-Price-Chart-300x155.jpg 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tezos-XTZ-Price-Chart-768x398.jpg 768w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tezos-XTZ-Price-Chart-380x197.jpg 380w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tezos-XTZ-Price-Chart-800x414.jpg 800w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tezos-XTZ-Price-Chart-1160x601.jpg 1160w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Making an XTZ price prediction may be difficult without assessing the token&#8217;s past performance. It helps to identify price fluctuation patterns and analyze which factors have the most significant influence. More so, Tezos news updates can affect the XTZ market movement and which will, in turn, affect the XTZ price.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tezos coin started its path with a scandal. It was launched in 2017. The ICO took place in July and was among the largest in terms of the accumulated investments. The price was average, and it was bouncing between $1.7 and slightly more than $2. Moreover, the company had to deal with a lawsuit over ICO. There were several of these lawsuits. The blame was on XTZ founders for selling unregistered assets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, of course, affected the token price. It only had started to increase and reached the $5 benchmark in December 2017, when another complaint was filed. As a result, it dropped down to $3.9 in a couple of days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"595\"  height=\"526\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-34471 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/dev.atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tezos-XTZ-Price-historical-data-2021.jpg\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tezos-XTZ-Price-historical-data-2021.jpg 595w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tezos-XTZ-Price-historical-data-2021-579x512.jpg 579w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tezos-XTZ-Price-historical-data-2021-228x202.jpg 228w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tezos-XTZ-Price-historical-data-2021-380x336.jpg 380w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the collapse wasn&#8217;t disastrous. Tezos price regained its position pretty fast and exceeded the maximum price at the beginning of January 2018, reaching $5.75. No matter how promising it may have been, 2018 happened to be a complicated year for all cryptocurrencies, with constant ups and downs. As a result, XTZ ended the year at a Tezos price USD of $0.5.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What affected Tezos coin price significantly at the time was a set of regulations. Know Your Customer (KYC), and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements were introduced in summer 2018. This became a problem for XTZ as no user data was collected during the ICO.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019 after a long bearish period, Tezos value finally started to regain its value. Three-fourth of the year (from March to December) were relatively prosperous. However, all cryptocurrencies were increasing in price at the time. Tezos performed better than others. XTZ value was estimated to have risen 1,000% during the year. It climbed from 22nd position up to 10th in the cryptocurrency ranking by Coinmarketcap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"market-prediction-for-tezos-xtz-price-2021\"><strong>Market prediction for Tezos(XTZ) price 2021:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017, the Tezos XTZ coin launch remained one of the most memorable Initial Coin Offering (ICO) to date. The scope of investment is twenty-four billion. Ever since then, the coin has been keeping a leading position in the market. For example, it&#8217;s considered one of the largest crypto, with a market capitalization of more than $2.5 billion as of late January 2021.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current market capitalization is $3.36 billion, while the Tezos current price trades at $4.49000 (6.87%) at the time of writing. XTZ is also the twenty-sixth largest crypto in the world by market capitalization.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a total of 762,493,497 Circulating XTZ Supply and a market cap of $3,411,836,085.00 and a twenty-four-hour volume of $600,808,767.00<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, it&#8217;s still early to rely on an optimistic XTZ price prediction alone. Traders are on guard because of the upcoming policy framework. Recently, the Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen said that cryptos could finance illicit activities, including terrorism. Nevertheless, she admitted that digital currencies could improve the efficiency of the financial system. This means that more regulations and policies are going to be introduced. As far as we know, they can both negatively and positively affect the price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s take a closer look at Tezos price predictions for 2021. As an overall observation, the estimations predict the XTZ coin price growth in 2021. But predictions differ in terms of scope and prediction firms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"trading-beasts-tezos-coin-price-prediction-2021\"><strong>Trading Beasts Tezos Coin Price Prediction 2021:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"506\"  height=\"1080\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-34472 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/dev.atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Trading-Beasts-Tezos-Coin-Price-Prediction-2021-506x1080.jpg\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Trading-Beasts-Tezos-Coin-Price-Prediction-2021-506x1080.jpg 506w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Trading-Beasts-Tezos-Coin-Price-Prediction-2021-240x512.jpg 240w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Trading-Beasts-Tezos-Coin-Price-Prediction-2021-95x202.jpg 95w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Trading-Beasts-Tezos-Coin-Price-Prediction-2021-380x811.jpg 380w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Trading-Beasts-Tezos-Coin-Price-Prediction-2021.jpg 547w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>TradingBeasts does justice to provide accurate price predictions for a wide range of digital coins like Tezos.

According to the XTZ price prediction, the Tezos price USD may be up to $4.52 in a year. It means that Tezos may double from the current value.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, Digital Coin Price is much more optimistic than Wallet Investor.

Suppose the current trend of the crypto market growth will persist up to 2022. XTZ will also gain in value, at least in terms of the XTZ to fiat ratio.

Once again, if we are to rely on the current trends of increasing crypto adoption, as a strong altcoin, Tezos is going to bloom. We have decided to break up the long-term XTZ price prediction by year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021 and 2022, Tezos is highly unlikely to be in a bearish movement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2023 is a controversial year in terms of predictions. For example, Trading Beasts predicts a drop in prices in the middle of the year\u2014down to $2.15 in June, to be precise. Later, however, the Tezos coin might regain its position and return to the $3 benchmark in December 2023. Generally, such volatility is quite average for Tezos.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2024 is supposed to be a much better year for Tezos. Both Trading Beasts and Digital Coin Price expect the coin to rise. Trading Beasts forecasts a gradual increase: XTZ will finish the year with a value of almost $4 on average.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2025 is going to be even better. That&#8217;s the year when the token is supposed to hit $10, according to Digital Coin Price. However, it won&#8217;t manage to secure too high of a price. The analysts expect that XTZ will drop down to $8 each time it reaches $9-$10.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"tezos-coin-xtz-price-prediction-verdict-nbsp\"><strong>Tezos coin (XTZ) Price Prediction Verdict:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s still hard to estimate the Tezos worth after ten years from now. Yet, one thing is clear: if the token remains on the market in 2030, it will have passed the test and will manage to mature. It means that it will have a reliable time-honored infrastructure and a pool of devoted users.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t far-fetched, considering that XTZ developers are constantly improving the technical backup and promoting the token on the market. Therefore, it&#8217;s likely that the token will reach its overall maximum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Tezos has already gained a significant position in the crypto market, it has already been criticized. Predominantly, of course, the critics focused on the lawsuits. Some community experts also don&#8217;t approve of the governance philosophy.
