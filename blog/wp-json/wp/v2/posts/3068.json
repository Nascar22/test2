It is designed to become a way of getting benefits from advertisements. BAT is developed alongside with the Brave Browser by the same team. The token is the utility asset in the Brave platform \u2014 it is used as a payment method for placing ads and also can be earned by users for watching those ads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brave has been proven to be a real thing \u2014 it gathered 5.5 million users within the first month after release in January 2016.
