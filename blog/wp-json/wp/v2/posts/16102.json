As with any technological breakthrough, the crypto industry has its influencers who have pushed the sphere forward and changed it forever. They have deserved to be known by the global community, and here is a great chance to meet some of them in one single article.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"joseph-lubin\">Joseph Lubin<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ethereumJoseph\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@ethereumJoseph<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the eight Ethereum founders, Joseph Lubin, saw the high potential of the blockchain from its earliest dawn. After reading the Satoshi Nakamoto paper on Bitcoin, he claimed the technology to be a possible organizing principle for the Earth for years, meaning it can replace the long list of currently existing inefficient systems.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joseph was born in Toronto, Canada, and had lived in the city for most of his life. Therefore, it is not a surprise that he has run into the Ethereum project, founded by Torontonians Vitalik Buterin and Antonio Di Iorio. Lubin firstly heard about Ether in 2013, and after a more in-depth exploration of the project, he claimed to support it publicly. As far as rumors go, Joseph has been one of the top buyers during the Ether crowd sale. Lubin continues to be one of the project&#8217;s primary driving forces nowadays.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is also a founder of ConsenSys, one of the fastest-growing companies in the blockchain world. Headquartered in New York, ConsenSys is a home for numerous&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/what-is-decentralization\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">decentralized<\/a>&nbsp;applications and tools for developers, aimed to expand the power of Ethereum and help governments and companies to adopt it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interesting facts:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Joseph Lubin believes that the future of the Internet is decentralized, and Web 3.0 will use Ethereum&#8217;s best features to make the world a much better place.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Lubin&#8217;s crypto net worth is estimated to be between $3-5 billion.<\/li><li>In ConsenSys, found by Lubin, decentralization is the law.

Started as an ordinary law worker, she later became a federal prosecutor focusing on fraud, cyber, and corporate crimes. She also led investigations around the famous Mt.Gox hack and the Silk Road story, along with the SEC, FBI and Treasury.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She first heard about Bitcoin in 2012, and she soon realized what is lying behind the BTC abbreviature. The Mt.Gox and Silk Road prosecutions made Haun a known person in Silicon Valley, and the top companies started to invite Katie to different events as a spokesman. As it turned out, she had crucial insights that could help blockchain startups to grow during the hard times.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haun left the Justice Department in 2017 and decided to dive into the world of Bitcoin and other blockchain projects deeper. She joined the board of Coinbase the same year, and one year later, she was invited to become an Andreessen Horowitz general partner.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for today, Katie actively invests in crypto startups and serves as an adviser for leading blockchain companies. She is convinced that cryptocurrencies will replace traditional payment systems in the next ten years, as rapidly, as cars have replaced horses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interesting facts:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Katie has taken part in the launch of&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/libra-coin\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Facebook&#8217;s Libra project<\/a>;<\/li><li>She is also the first-ever female general partner of Andreessen Horowitz.

Brendan Blumer is an American entrepreneur who started his big technological journey very early and still could not stop changing the world. At the age of 15, Brendan created a website where people could buy virtual assets for popular MMORPG games. He called the company Gamecliff, and that was his first acquaintance with the world of digital finances.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After Brendan had graduated from school, his company Gamecliff was acquired by IGE, and Brendan moved to Hong Kong. A few years later, in 2007, Blumer founded the Account Network that also specialized in selling in-game goods. It was Brendan&#8217;s first big success as the platform reached a $1 mln monthly revenue, and that fact gave him wings to make something even more prominent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blumer did not miss the chance and founded one of the biggest platforms for selling, buying, and renting a property in Asia Okay.com. Onwards upwards, and in 2016 Brendan met a software programmer Daniel Lammer, with whom one year later, they founded a Block.one company specializing in high-performance blockchain technologies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their first project&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/eos-coin-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">EOS<\/a>.attracted public attention not only with the technologies and ideas but also with its ambitious plans to collect $1 billion during ICO.

Gavin has been with the project since its earliest stages. However, today Andresen and most of his Bitcoin teammates are on different sides, and there is a story behind it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gavin Andresen firstly heard about Bitcoin in 2010. He understood the brilliance of the technology and created a website called Bitcoin Faucet that gave BTC away. Andresen was not officially involved in the Bitcoin project, but he believed in it and wanted people to try it themselves. He also started to communicate with Satoshi Nakamoto via email and create some code for the BTC project. Although most people give all the credits for Bitcoin development to Satoshi, Gavin Andresen has been a lead developer of the project for almost seven years, from 2011 to 2017. As you might have guessed, there have been a lot of changes and improvements to the original Bitcoin during the time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, Andresen created the Bitcoin Foundation. The main goal of the company was collecting money and resources from all over the world to support BTC, pay talented developers, and generally improve Bitcoin. Also, Bitcoin Foundation was meant to connect BTC with the legal world of national authorities. Although Gavin Andresen did a lot for Bitcoin, he was slowly going separate way by programming less and becoming a public person rather. He did not discuss solutions with the team, neither did he commit any code to GitHub, even though he was still a lead developer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May 2016, he shared a blog post, which claimed Australian programmer Craig Wright was the real Satoshi Nakamoto. The public did not take it too seriously, while the team did, and Gavin had lost his access to commit any code to Bitcoin&#8217;s GitHub repository, and that was the start of his withdrawal from the project. In 2017 he left Bitcoin Core and started to support its rival &#8211; Bitcoin Cash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interesting facts:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>To launch Bitcoin Faucet, Andresen bought 10,000 BTC for $50 that was given away to the first users of the platform;<\/li><li>Under Andresen&#8217;s leadership, 2\/3 of the original Bitcoin code was refactored.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"adam-back\">Adam Back<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/adam3us\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@adam3us<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam Back is a British cryptographer and businessman who has contributed to stabilizing Bitcoin and helped its spreading across the world. Has been working on e-cash protocols since 1995, Back has created the Hashcash algorithm, that we all know is used in Bitcoin. It is the foundation of&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/bitcoin-mining\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BTC mining<\/a>&nbsp;as we know it today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has also founded a Blockstream company, aimed at the further development of Bitcoin and improving blockchain technology, as well as spreading both across the globe. Blockstream is a home for hundreds of BTC developers, and they are getting paid for their hard work by Adam&#8217;s company.

She held the position of Head of XRP Institutional Liquidity and was responsible for working with custody agents, exchanges, market makers, fund managers, OTC desks, and institutional investors.

As Peter confessed years later, it was just a side project in the beginning, and very few people were interested. The things had changed in 2013, where the sphere started to rise, and more and more attention was coming to Bitcoin.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for today, it is not a side project anymore, with more than 200,000 daily transactions and a $1 bln of funds transferred using Blockchain.com each month.
