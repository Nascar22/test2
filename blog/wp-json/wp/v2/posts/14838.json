Bitcoin Private is trading on several major markets, yet the most active exchange that trades BTCP is Graviex.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-time high of Bitcoin Private, $86.73, was reached on Mar 12, 2018 &#8211; at the time of its creation and in the aftermath of the most famous cryptocurrency bull-run of Winter 2017-2018.

Currently, the estimated ROI (return on investment) of Bitcoin Private is -99.81%, which means that $100 worth of BTCP bought at the time of the Bitcoin Private launch would not yield any profit today, but rather eat up the whole investment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most recent price trend of Bitcoin Private appears to be neutral. While in 24 hours, the price of BTCP rose by 18.05%, the 7-day price dynamics show a -0.29% decrease in the price of BTCP. Either way, the price predictions for Bitcoin Private are usually quite pessimistic. According to WalletInvestor, Bitcoin Private is a bad long-term investment. In one year from now, the price of BTCP may be as low as $0.00857, which would mark a multi-fold decrease compared to the current price. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that price manipulations of BTCP are possible due to the extremely low market capitalization, so one should be very careful when investing in Bitcoin Private.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-bitcoin-private\">What is Bitcoin Private<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Created in March 2018, Bitcoin Private (BTCP) is a community-driven cryptocurrency that was created as a fork of Zclassic and Bitcoin.
