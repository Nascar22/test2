Tron wants to DECENTRALIZE THE WEB. Meanwhile, Tron&#8217;s focus is not just on decentralizing finance and money. It aims to decentralize content-sharing and entertainment. No doubt, few entertainment giants centralize and control content distribution on the internet. These companies rake in massive revenue from adverts and consumer subscriptions. At the same time, they serve the content creators peanuts out of the income. Hence, Tron wants to build an ecosystem whereby content creators will enjoy direct and full compensation for their work.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tron runs an open blockchain network that has a distributed storage facility. Thus, it is efficient in storing content, and transactions are fast. Tronix (TRX) is the token for the Tron network. TRX serves as a means by which consumers pay content producers and developers. Developers can as well create their coins. However, this has to run on the Tron blockchain. Payment for content goes directly to producers&#8217; wallets, and thereby they receive full compensation for their work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tron is a project of the Tron Foundation. Tron Foundation is a Singapore-based non-profit entity that operates the Tron network. Tron Foundation has the responsibility to ensure transparency, openness, and fairness in Tron&#8217;s development. Justin Sun is the founder of the Tron Foundation and the brain behind Tron. Likewise, Sun is the founder of Peiwo, a live-streaming app. During the initial-coin-offering of TRX in 2017, Tron Foundation was able to raise $70 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"tron-price-chart\"><strong>Tron price Chart<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1280\"  height=\"720\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-34349 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/tron-price-chart.png\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/tron-price-chart.png 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/tron-price-chart.png 910w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/tron-price-chart.png 768w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/tron-price-chart.png 1920w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/tron-price-chart.png 1536w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/tron-price-chart.png 2048w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/tron-price-chart.png 380w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/tron-price-chart.png 1280w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"market-prediction-for-tron-trx-price-2021\"><strong>Market prediction for Tron (TRX) price 2021<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tron&#8217;s current price has been very reluctant to go close to $0.1. Since it had a $0.3 all-time high in 2018, there has been no major Tron news. TRX price continues to consolidate around $0.01 and $0.06 since January 2020 to date. Why is there no better Tron news? Some experts blame Tron&#8217;s supply. Of course, a ton of over 100 billion tokens could keep a coin at the ground level. However, other cryptocurrency enthusiasts blame Justin Sun, the CEO of Tron. Sun is known for pushing announcements that end up not happening. Disappointments can scare off investors, and it has scared many away from buying Tron.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, during this write-up, the Tron coin price is $0.0460. It has a live market capitalization of over $3,298,073,000, and it ranks 25 among other crypto assets. Currently, the amount of Tron circulating is 71,659,657,370 TRX. However, some reports say it is 71,659,659,265 TRX that is in circulation. Meanwhile, Tron&#8217;s total token is over 100.8 billion TRX tokens. Yet, there is no information about its maximum supply. TRX currently trades on about two-hundred crypto-trading exchanges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"tron-predictions-for-2021\"><strong>Tron Predictions for 2021<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are various opinions and Tron predictions. Some cryptocurrency investors and analysts gave ideas on how far TRX prices could go in 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"crypto-ground-tron-price-prediction-2021\"><strong>Crypto Ground Tron Price Prediction 2021<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>CryptoGround is a news media website that serves cryptocurrency and blockchain news.

At launch, Tron operated on the ERC-20 network. However, to fulfill its goals, Tron created its blockchain, which is the TRC-10. The Tron network has a high transaction speed, and payment fees are relatively low. Tron&#8217;s use-case also extends to the hosting of decentralized applications and smart contracts. Developers or content creators who work on the Tron network use TRX as a means of payment. Currently, there are over 23 million Tron accounts, according to stats on the Tron website. Also, over 1.6 billion transactions have been processed on the Tron network so far.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, there are over 1,600 decentralized applications (Dapps) on the Tron public chain. These Dapps boast of about $24.75 million in transaction volume. The growing adoption of the Tron network could be the solution to Tron&#8217;s low price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>TRX has existed since 2017, and it is still struggling to hit $0.1. A stagnant price is not a good sign for buyers in comparison to other crypto assets. Meanwhile, Tron CEO Justin Sun is quite influential and popular. Recently, he made it to the &#8220;Asia 30 under 30&#8221; Forbes list. However, there was no improvement in the Tron coin price. Even within the crypto community, Sun does not have much recognition. These setbacks could be the reason why the Tron price USD remains relatively low.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"tron-price-prediction-2025\"><strong>Tron Price Prediction 2025<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Majorly, long-term cryptocurrency bag holders reap high returns on investments. However, things might take the other way sometimes, and some coins may fail to pump in the long-run. Many cryptocurrency price analysis websites have bullish Tron news for 2025. CryptoGround predicted that Tron would sell at $0.1 in the next five years. Likewise, Digital-Coin-Price forecast that by 2025, Tron price USD will be above $0.13.

Completing these development stages will improve Tron news could be an add-on to drive Tron value higher.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To decentralize the web, Tron has to work with real firms that believe in blockchain. First, Tron Foundation acquired BitTorrent and integrated its 100 million users into the Tron network. Furthermore, Tron became partners with various companies across Asia. One of the many partners of Tron is oBike. oBike developed a utility token on the Tron blockchain, which customers can use to pay the company. Likewise, Bitmain, Zag \u2013 S&amp;W, and Global Social Chain are partners of Tron. Partnerships can spread Tron news as it drives adoption.
