It was the time of reaching the all-time high \u2014 it was $1,18 on the 6th of January. The price went into a bearish trend for the rest of the year. At the beginning of November, REQ went cheaper than the initial price and decreased even more dramatically. REQ was trading around $0,02 for the rest of the year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first half of 2019 was the period of fighting for support. The chart climbed to the $0,03 line and slid to $0,018 twice. In July, the price went even lower than it was and established between $0,008 and $0,019. That sideway continued for the second part of the year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of this article writing in December 2019, the current REQ price is $0,010229.

The asset is definitely worth noticing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-request-network-req\">What is Request Network (REQ)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Request Network is an Ethereum-based blockchain project designed to become a next-generation payment system. Its main emphasis is creating a platform that will be an alternative to PayPal. The project intends to be integrated with all the everyday financial services: banks, government, taxes and peer-to-peer transactions. The project is named \u2018Request\u2019 because one of the first features is transactions request similar to PayPal\u2019s one. The roadmap of Request Network includes adding features of making invoices, B2B-services and many more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The blockchain works with its native token called REQ. It is an ERC20-based cryptocurrency that allows using all the specter of Ethereum-based tokens as an exchange option inside the net. This token works with the proof-of-stake algorithm (also known as PoS), which means that users can earn profits only by holding the asset in the special wallet. REQ is required for paying operation fees for the blockchain\u2019s services. The fees can vary depending on the processed block size.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The technical part of the project is quite original and makes its own ecosystem. There are three main parts of the Request Network:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The Core Layer. It is the blockchain itself that functions as the payment platform and features smart contracts running. On top of that, this layer can process information from outside the system with an Oracle service\u2019s help.<\/li><li>The Extensions Layer. It is the platform for all the advanced payment schemes: B2B, government, taxes, invoices and so on. This layer works with the flexible algorithm that allows adjusting payments \u2014 for example, you can set it to send salary paychecks once a week instead of two weeks.<\/li><li>The Application Layer. This one works with out-chain software and networks. Any third-party applications can be integrated with the Request in order to manage invoices, payments or any other similar matters.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The team behind the project is a fintech company Moneytis. It is headed by Christopher Lassuyt and Etienne Tatur, two experienced professionals in financial and IT matters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"request-req-wallet\">Request (REQ) Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your crypto wisely!
