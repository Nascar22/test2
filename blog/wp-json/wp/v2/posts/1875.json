Zooko Wilcox, CEO of the company, says that their main objective was to create a coin that wouldn\u2019t have bitcoin\u2019s drawbacks and, thus, would be presenting its alternative. With that end in view, the team provided Zcash with an algorithm similar to bitcoin plus enabled semi-transparent processing.&nbsp;Zcash&nbsp;avoids the total transparency of bitcoin\u2019s blockchain and&nbsp;allows&nbsp;its&nbsp;users&nbsp;to&nbsp;keep the details of their transactions in private&nbsp;being able to send money to any part of the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The payment is made in&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/zcash-wallet\">ZEC&nbsp;<\/a>, the company\u2019s currency, which can be purchased and stored at different exchanges and wallets, for instance,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/\">Atomic<\/a>&nbsp;where you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/zcash-price-prediction\">manage ZEC<\/a>&nbsp;and over 300 other coins and tokens as well as&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/zcash-price-prediction#exchange\">exchange your assets<\/a>&nbsp;via non-custodial Atomic Swap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2018 bear market wasn\u2019t easy on Zcash price as well as on the rest of the cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;In November, the&nbsp;ZEC price dropped by 88%&nbsp;compared to its highest cost. Nevertheless,&nbsp;Zcash&nbsp;stayed in the&nbsp;top 30 biggest cryptocurrencies&nbsp;in terms of market capitalization and managed to slowly regain value. The Zcash current price is&nbsp;$52,01 USD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in buying ZEC, you can benefit from Atomic Wallet which supports over 300 coins and tokens in a single interface and allows users to make Atomic Swaps for many popular currency pairs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"coin\"><span id=\"what-is-zcash\">What is ZCash?<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/zcash-wallet\">Zcash (ZEC)<\/a>&nbsp;was developed by&nbsp;an American Colorado-based computer security specialist&nbsp;Zooko Wilcox-O&#8217;Hearn&nbsp;in 2016. Known for his ascetic lifestyle, the cypherpunk designed a privacy-focused blockchain with a market capitalization of more than $350 million.&nbsp;Zcash uses particular cryptography which protects&nbsp;the security of its&nbsp;user and doesn\u2019t disclose any information&nbsp;on the transaction&nbsp;without the user\u2019s prior consent. Such anonymity is provided by the proof of construction protocol named&nbsp;zk-snark. In contrast to Bitcoin which requires verification of every single transaction, Zcash keeps both users&#8217; balance and the number of transactions in private.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ZEC has a total supply of 21 million coins which are expected to be mined by 2150. The Zcash news report that the platform processes one block for 2,5 minutes which is 4 times faster than Bitcoin. Zcash (ZEC)<br>38.42 USD&nbsp;(1.59%)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/s2.coinmarketcap.com\/static\/img\/coins\/64x64\/1437.png\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The capacity of Zcash to maintain the privacy of transactions has attracted numerous customers and established partnerships with different institutions around the globe. Moreover, the company\u2019s protocol has recently been replicated by&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/ethereum-wallet\">Ethereum<\/a>&nbsp;blockchain, as it is reported on the Zcash news.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To date, ZEC has risen to 20th place in spite of its market cap being reduced by an amount of $2.3 billion. The rise in popularity is attributable to society\u2019s growing interest in privacy concerns which are met and respected by the Zcash company. As you can see in the picture, the Zcash current price has been maintained within the last few months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"market\"><span id=\"market-prediction-for-zcash-price-in-2019\">Market prediction for Zcash Price in 2019<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether the Zcash value rises throughout this year is contingent on many factors and, unfortunately, the ZEC price is largely determined by the behavior of market players which is hard to predict. However, some crypto experts were able to make forecasts on the Zcash value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-zcash-price-prediction-by-beincrypto\">#1 Zcash price prediction by BeInCrypto<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether the Zcash value rises throughout this year is contingent on many factors and, unfortunately, the ZEC price is largely determined by the behavior of market players which is hard to predict. However, some crypto experts were able to make forecasts on the Zcash value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-zcash-price-prediction-by-matthew-beck\">#2 Zcash price prediction by Matthew Beck<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An analyst at Grayscale Investment, Matthew Beck shows more belief in ZEC. In his investment thesis, Beck explores the prospects of the coin development considering it to be a perfect substitute for traditional offshore banking because of the increasing competition and more strict tax regulation. Thus, if the altcoin is widely used by investors, it might hit $60,000 USD in 2025, says Matthew Beck in the Zcash news.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-zcash-price-prediction-by-john-young\">#3 Zcash price prediction by John Young<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another Zcash prediction was made by John Young, a financial analyst and the author of the Spreadstreetblog. His forecast is based on the Monte Carlo simulation method which calculates possible price outcomes. The algorithm takes into consideration the current Zcash price and coin behavior in the past. This, Young indicates an average price that Zcash might reach during the year and give a one-year stimulation of the coin price, as you can see below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"4-zcash-price-prediction-by-walletinvestor\">#4 Zcash price prediction by WalletInvestor<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A rather bearish Zcash prediction is given by WalletInvestor, a website displaying cryptocurrency price changes and statistics. Thus, the analysts of the platform predict that Zcash is likely to reduce by much, falling below&nbsp;$10 USD&nbsp;throughout the year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While in the short term WalletInvestor is positive on Zcash price, as the forecast trend line for the coin moves upwards, in the long term the prediction is negative, as analysts expect ZEC to lose about 90% of its value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"5-zcash-price-prediction-by-tradingbeasts\">#5 Zcash price prediction by TradingBeasts<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of a few bullish forecasts on Zcash price was made by TradingBeasts. According to the website analytics, Zcash coin price will vary from $140 to $220 over the course of the year but its value will be gradually decreasing, as you can see in the table below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2019\"><span id=\"zcash-price-prediction-2019\">Zcash price prediction 2019<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the fact that 2018 saw a huge collapse of numerous coins including ZEC, the latter has been maintaining stability over the past months. Like other coins, Zcash coin price is mostly determined by the market sentiment which, luckily, stays positive towards the coin. Even though it is hard to predict how public perception might change over time, we still may explore what factors it might be influenced by.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, last September saw an upgrade of Zcash which made it compatible with far more devices than it was before, according to the Zcash news. Sapling, the long-awaited update, is aimed at making transactions faster and easier while the privacy of users will still be protected. According to Zcash, the time for processing a transaction will be six times less than before while a transaction itself will take a hundred times less memory space. Ever since the launch of Sapling, many users reported better performance of the platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, Zcash price growth may be driven by the coin\u2019s integration into mobile wallets, as mobile payments are gradually gaining in popularity. With a bigger audience, the company is likely to see the value of its coin go up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Briefly, Zcash predictions are rather optimistic, as experts show belief in the coin\u2019s potential. Only time will tell whether Zcash coin price will meet the public expectations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2020\"><span id=\"zcash-price-prediction-2020\">Zcash price prediction 2020<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking ahead, experts disagree about the possible price of Zcash. While some of them assure us that its&nbsp;price is likely to range from $20&nbsp;to $40, others stay more optimistic about Zcash performance in the following 2 years.&nbsp;Thus, ZEC is expected to reach $360 if the coin is integrated into mobile wallets&nbsp;which will undoubtedly attract a bigger audience and boost the price. Another important fact that might positively influence the value of the currency is that the number of coins is limited, and the more ZEC is mined, the higher is the price for the rest of the coins.&nbsp;The company plans to maintain miners interest in ZEC by increasing their reward by one fourth and expects the coin\u2019s price to hit $700. One way or another, the whole crypto market is expected to be up by 2020 which cannot but contribute positively to Zcash value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"verdict\"><span id=\"zcash-price-prediction-verdict\">Zcash Price Prediction Verdict<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Zcash saw its price falling by much last year, the company managed to keep the value of the coin stable. As we have seen above, Zcash has successfully found a way to improve the platform performance, making transactions lighter and faster which is advantageous both for the company and users. This upgrade called Sapling has been one of the reasons behind the coin\u2019s stable position in the cryptocurrency rating, explains. Another step towards a better market sentiment towards the coin will include its integration into mobile payment systems, as we can learn from Zcash news. Thus, we believe that Zcash is highly likely to attract investors worldwide due to its privacy-focused blockchain and other advantages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Atomic wallet offers you an opportunity to buy and manage Zcash as well as over 300 other coins and tokens in a single interface.
