It&#8217;s a cryptocurrency project from Singapore. Its main goal is providing a cryptocurrency service with wide adoption and simplicity for everyday use. The project currently aims at the South-East Asia market. The reason is financial underdevelopment: 73% of the SEA population don\u2019t have a bank account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their key product designed for improving crypto adoption is XPOS. It is a point-of-sale terminal allowing crypto payments in any kind of B2C business: grocery stores, restaurants, gyms and so on. XPOS looks much like a simple cashier terminal but works with the Ethereum platform allowing quick and easy payments in crypto. The company is planning to ship 100 000 devices in the first three years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pundi X is based on the Ethereum platform. The project\u2019s native token is called \u2018Pundi X\u2019 (the ticker is NPXS). It is an ERC-20 token designed to support the ecosystem and help it to develop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project was first announced on March 8, 2018. The presale started in September 2018 and finished on the ICO date \u2014 January 21, 2019. Since then, NPXS got listed on 24 major exchanges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"pundi-x-npxs-technical-features\">Pundi X (NPXS) Technical Features<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pundi X has a quite sophisticated distribution policy. Upon the ICO, the purchasers only got 30% of the amount they had previously bought. The rest is enrolled monthly according to smart contracts users must sign on a regular basis. But the main requirement of these contracts is that a user must hold the amount through the whole 3-year period. On top of that, NPXS is not mined, it only can be bought. Technically it works with the Proof-of-Stake algorithm but it cannot be earned by staking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Pundi X (NPXS) Technical Features\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/Js8MVLA4zPzNUoTQjTOYxf49OPS_fC9wTeWZ9bZm6Tl2q-Blve-3PiwW1NKOoYyMl52pcE0HHn5r3FQpKC0f_d98gELRPNnFAKQiMFwQcZQMoWSwSNfeHhANg2BnbYacmNFSFc90\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As was said, Pundi X works on the Ethereum platform, but it also involves different financial institutions for crypto and fiat conversions and transactions. In order to gain the support of fiat financial organizations, Pundi X runs a policy of transparency. As a part of it, everyone who wants to sign in the Pundi\u2019s ecosystem must go through a KYC control procedure. On top of that, the platform is open for developers, so anyone can make an app for XPOS for NPXS charges. Also, NPXS is the native token for in-app transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, it\u2019s curious that Pundi X is one of the few cryptocurrencies that pick offline as the main promotion space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"market-features-on-analyzing-pundi-price-prediction-2020\">Market Features on analyzing Pundi price prediction 2020<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Pundi X (NPXS) Market Features\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/rj0Tf3jYgmWWZAkQmpfQ5RNFPP0dAnx77hAwoodIqLc3rs8L3BlzcSS_llwlzq9-4-S4HXpAd_ZUSPMuBrtBU6SfO5RLV887Sn0CzyNEWg3E0ApaNy-FUsz35PEfWAcoTeBehsBF\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As of this writing in December 2019 Pundi X price is $0,000152. The all-time high was $0,015621 on the 17th of June, 2018. The all-time low was reached recently on the crypto market drop: NPXS price was $0,000127 on November 25, 2019. 234 562 817 276 NPXS is in current circulation with the total supply of 259 810 708 833 NPXS. The maximum supply was never announced, but it is not clear how new coins will be issued. Pundi X has $35 720 658 of the market cap which allows it to take line 98 in CoinMarketCap\u2019s crypto rating by market cap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s remarkable that the NPXS price was harshly fluctuating during the presale but after the ICO it took the sideway where it stays till now. On top of that, the market cap is constantly changing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/price-prediction\/bitcoin-price-prediction-2021\"><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\">Read more on bitcoin price prediction.<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"pundi-x-news-on-pundi-price-prediction-2020\">Pundi X News on Pundi price prediction 2020<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"pundi-x-announces-a-blockchain-smartphone\">Pundi X Announces A Blockchain Smartphone<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the loudest Pundi X news is the announcement of their BOB Smartphone.
