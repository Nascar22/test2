The circulating supply is 16,128,516,759 XVG. The daily trading volume is around $884,548.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-time high of Verge, $0.300588, was reached on December 23, 2017. On the other hand, the all-time low of Verge, $0.000002, occurred way back on February 5, 2015. Currently, the estimated ROI (return on investment) of XVG is &gt; 9000%, which means that $100 worth of XVG bought at the time of the Tether launch would yield more than $9000 of profit today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, Verge did not conduct an ICO (initial coin offering), nor did it pre-mine any coins in advance. Back at the time, the currency was known as DogeCoinDark, before being rebranded into Verge in 2016. Before that, the community was really not that big, which is why the price had not shown serious dynamics for two years. There was not much trading either. At the time, the price of the coin was equal to a mere $0.000005. The huge coin supply was one of the major contributors to such a low price.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon after rebranding, the price rose to $0.00001, which marked a 100% increase. Ever since then and through the first months of 2017, the price continued to grow slowly. The growth was supported by the release of an official &#8220;black paper,&#8221; which explained the roadmap of the project in detail and thus clarified the prospects of the project.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What followed afterward was the crazy bull trend of late 2017, which made the whole market sore, and Verge was not an exception. To give an indication: in December, the price of XVG was $0.005. In just three weeks, it went all the way up to $0.14, which means a 2,700% increase.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A somewhat controversial thing happened just after that: John McAfee, a prominent personality in the cryptocurrency world, posted a tweet about Verge, calling it a good coin to invest in and making a price prediction of $15 for XVG. This, allegedly, led to a further increase in the price of Verge to $0.3, which became its historical high. Given the enormous supply of XVG, the total market capitalization went over $4 billion. Unfortunately for the coin, but in line with the overall market trend, the price started to drop right after that and has not been able to recover ever since. Such a change can be attributed not only to the general bear trend that took over the cryptocurrency market but also to the fact that other anonymity-focused currencies, such as Zcash, came to prominence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2017, John McAfee named Verge as one of the most promising cryptocurrencies alongside Monero and Zcash. Today there are more than 80 online resources that accept payments in XVG.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to WalletInvestor, the price of Verge (XVG) may reach $0.00411 in 2020, while in 5 years, the XVG price may change to $0.0069. <a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/verge-xvg-price-prediction-2020\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-verge-xvg-nbsp\">What is Verge (XVG)&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Verge (XVG) is a decentralized open-source cryptocurrency with a strong focus on anonymity and privacy. Launched in 2014 as a fork of Dogecoin called DogeCoinDark and rebranded into Verge in 2016, the company became famous after partnering with Pornhub in 2018. It is possible to pay for a premium subscription with Verge (XVG).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main feature of Verge is the ability to obfuscate the users&#8217; IP address and location using I2P (Invisible Internet Project) and TOR (The Onion Router) network layers. While anyone can view the transactions that occur on the Verge ledger, the participants&#8217; location or IP cannot be identified. All Core Verge wallets offer built-in TOR integration, supported by an additional level of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Verge runs of a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism and uses five types of mining algorithms: Scrypt, X17, Blake2s, Groestl, and Lyra2rev2. Unlike other anonymity-focused digital currencies, e.g., Monero and Dash, it offers more transparency in public verification of transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"verge-xvg-wallet\">Verge (XVG) Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your crypto wisely!
