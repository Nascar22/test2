Not only ETH made it possible for the introduction of different currencies but also it allowed to build smart contracts triggering the mechanism of task execution after certain terms are fulfilled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/OJK0JxA.gif\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite a big push, ETH has made towards the development of the IT sphere, some time after the introduction it showed certain vulnerabilities of its own.<br><br>Thus, today ETH cannot compare with some other currencies in terms of the quantity and speed of transactions which inexorably influences the price and investment inflow. No wonder that the dev team is looking forward to introducing certain changes on the platform which will be known as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/constantinople-ethereum-hardfork\">hard fork<\/a>. But looking forward, this hard fork alone won\u2019t make a difference unless it is followed by other big changes on the platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ethereum-improvements\">Ethereum Improvements<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  width=\"519\"  height=\"292\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/57\/df\/c5\/57dfc5ae2bcca6fe1d57958c05c5267e.gif\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ethereum&#8217;s introduction consists of 4 stages.

The latest figures indicate that the hard fork is postponed to February, 27. Now let\u2019s see if experts are optimistic about Ethereum in 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ethereum-price-prediction\">Ethereum price prediction<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/media1.tenor.com\/images\/8036239a61d91dffc00af2754aca7948\/tenor.gif\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The volatility of the market does not allow us to be certain about the future of the crypto world; however, experts are able to make some predictions based on the platform roadmap and market trends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ethereum-price-market-prediction\">Ethereum Price Market Prediction<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus,&nbsp;A.T.Kearney, one of the world prime consulting companies, has recently published an analysis report&nbsp;predicting that by the end of 2019 altcoins will be strongly dominated by Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization which will significantly decrease the price of most of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another negative estimation is made by&nbsp;Tim Enneking, head of Digital Capital Management, who sees an increase in the price as \u201cunlikely\u201d&nbsp;since there is no reason for Ethereum to double its cost. Therefore, 2019 might be promising for other digital currencies that are able to overcome ETH.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, other experts are more optimistic about the future of Ethereum. For instance,&nbsp;Joseph Raczynski, innovator and founder of a number of companies including technology consulting firm JoeTechnologist.com, believes the ETH price will reach&nbsp;$1200&nbsp;within this year taking into account that 2019 will bring certain positive changes in Ethereum network which will positively influence the price of the coin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, shows a certain optimism about changes in Ethereum network which would boost the price of the coin up to&nbsp;$1900, as major vulnerabilities will be solved and new investment will flow in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another even more optimistic prediction has been made by the deVere group&nbsp;offering financial consulting services to numerous companies worldwide.&nbsp;Nigel Green, CEO of the group, has recently mentioned that Ethereum price might jump to $2500&nbsp;by the end of this year. He explains such optimistic prediction by constantly increasing use of cloud computing and smart contracts together with the emergence of new cryptocurrencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A bit more humble prediction is made by a traders community&nbsp;Trading Beasts. The experts talk about Ethereum staying at $650 during the year and hitting $900 by the end of 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ethereum-price-prediction-2020\">Ethereum price prediction 2020<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the next year, let\u2019s start with a prediction of online analyst Bobby Ullery. He assumes that blockchain will be constantly gaining popularity and at least half of the cryptomarket will be held by two major currencies: Bitcoin and Ethereum which will inevitably influence their price. As Vitalik Buterin estimates the total circulation of ETH to be 100 mln coins, Ullery assumes that by the end of 2020 the currency price might hit $11,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Less optimistic are experts from LongForecast service who expect ETH to hit $724 in January 2020, and fall down to $470 over the course of the following months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ethereum-5-years-price-prediction\">Ethereum 5 years price prediction<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking forward, Ethereum price prediction for the following 5 years is rather positive. Despite the vulnerability of the market and a constantly changing environment, most experts unanimously predict that Ethereum price might jump to $30,000 over the course of 5 years. Unlike some ordinary users considering ETH together with other cryptos to be a bubble, experts highlight a steadily growing demand for ETH all over the world and an enormous potential of blockchain as a technology which won\u2019t allow the currency price to drop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1355\"  height=\"403\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  class=\"wp-image-14363 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 1355px) 100vw, 1355px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/ethereum-price-december-2019-1.png\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/ethereum-price-december-2019-1.png 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/ethereum-price-december-2019-1.png 1024w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/ethereum-price-december-2019-1.png 768w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/ethereum-price-december-2019-1.png 1920w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/ethereum-price-december-2019-1.png 1536w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/ethereum-price-december-2019-1.png 2048w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/ethereum-price-december-2019-1.png 380w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/ethereum-price-december-2019-1.png 1355w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-choose-ethereum-wallet\">How To Choose Ethereum Wallet<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In Atomic Wallet your&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/what-are-private-keys-and-how-they-work\">private keys are encrypted<\/a>&nbsp;in your device and never leave it, so you can be sure that your money is under your control only.
