The circulating supply is 945,942,669 EOS. The daily trading volume is around $1,652,503,620.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-time high of EOS, $22.89, was reached in April 2018. The estimated ROI (return on investment) of EOS is 142.58%, which means that $100 worth of EOS bought at the time of the EOS launch would yield $142.58 today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When EOS was introduced in July 2017, the price of a single token was only $0.01 (one cent). Thanks to the extensive promotion and targeted advertising on social media, the price of EOS grew rapidly and reached a $1 mark just one month after its launch. Already after two months, the price was at a $5 level. EOS market capitalization went over $200 million; that was enough for the newcomer to enter the top 20 cryptocurrency list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then in September 2017, when all other cryptocurrencies were experiencing steady growth, all of a sudden, the price of EOS dropped down to $0.6. That sharp drop is usually attributed to the active growth of EOS\u2019s significant competitors &#8211; Ethereum and NEO, as well as to a rising distrust of the user community. Nevertheless, Dan Larimer and developers managed to retain the interest in their project, and EOS is currently a permanent member of the top 10 cryptocurrency list.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2018 was a tough year for all cryptocurrencies, including EOS. Throughout the whole year, the price of EOS was falling until it reached the level of $2.5 in December; a year later, the situation stays the same, despite a considerable increase in price up to $9 in May 2019.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In April 2018, all top 10 cryptocurrencies experienced a price spike, but EOS led the pack. While other cryptocurrencies went up by around 6%, EOS experienced an 18.27% increase in a single day on April 11th. That was when EOS had its all-time high, unlike many other currencies, which just benefited from the bullish trend in December 2017.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the coin\u2019s strong position in the top list of cryptocurrencies and a lot of attention from institutional investors, it seems that recently EOS has been following the general market behavior in terms of price dynamics. Currently, the analysis of EOS\/USD and EOS\/BTC pairs indicates a prolonged disappearing that is slowly waning.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The technical uniqueness of EOS attracts the attention of many prominent entrepreneurs who are planning to deploy their projects in EOS. Nevertheless, to reach high adoption, a lot of technical work and development still needs to be done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If all the development goals are met in the next few years, EOS may experience a significant increase in price. While the majority of forecasts are unanimously positive about the bright future of the coin, Walletinvestor even predicts an increase in price up to $6 in 2020.

The EOS token is the internal currency of the EOS network. The smart contract platform eliminates transaction fees while conducting millions of transactions per second.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Launched in 2017 by a group of developers led by Dan Larimer, EOS raised $4 billion during ICO, proving it stands apart from other cryptocurrencies both in its technology and the scale of its goals.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While conceptually similar to platforms like Ethereum and NEO, EOS focuses on critical weak points of blockchain. It attempts to combat the problems of scalability, speed, and flexibility that may limit such blockchain-based systems. Some of the unique features of EOS are asynchronous communication methodology within the network and the use of parallel execution. EOS runs on the Proof-of-Stake algorithm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the advantages of EOS that make it so popular among developers include easy deployment and upgrade of DApps (decentralized applications), as well as bug recovery. Besides, the EOS blockchain offers data protection, secure communication, and censorship resistance to developers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"eos-wallet\">EOS Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your crypto wisely!
