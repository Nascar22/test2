Decentralized (public) blockchains are built as distributed systems, i.e., if you want to send or\/and receive crypto from someone you don\u2019t need to engage third-party service in the process (Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, etc.).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of proof of stake algorithm, it works also on the connection between unknown peers in a dispersed network of the system users. The mechanism verifies the transactions, spreading the information between all the nodes in the blockchain. It ensures that the transactions occur in a trustless way, and each newly added block is a trustworthy one. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"created\"><span id=\"why-was-pos-created\">Why was PoS created?<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1380\"  height=\"480\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"why was PoS created\"  class=\"wp-image-8269 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 1380px) 100vw, 1380px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/what-is-proof-of-stake-1.png\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/what-is-proof-of-stake-1.png 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/what-is-proof-of-stake-1.png 1024w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/what-is-proof-of-stake-1.png 768w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/what-is-proof-of-stake-1.png 1920w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/what-is-proof-of-stake-1.png 1536w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/what-is-proof-of-stake-1.png 2048w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/what-is-proof-of-stake-1.png 380w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/what-is-proof-of-stake-1.png 1380w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly, this paragraph will describe the dilemma \u2018Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Proof of Stake (PoW) was first depicted in 2009 at a Bitcointalk post as an alternative to <a href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/proof-of-stake-vs-proof-of-work\">Proof of Work (PoW) <\/a>algorithm. The project aspired to unravel and fix the principle weaknesses of Proof of Work.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if the PoS and PoW have goals alike, the roots of the two mechanisms have fundamental differences, especially when it comes to the new blocks\u2019 creation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Briefly, the PoS consensus replaces the process of mining new blocks, which is used in the PoW, with the mechanism of validation. There the rights to adding new blocks are distributed between the participants according to their stake in the blockchain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The validator of each block (also called forger, baker, or minter) is defined by a cryptocurrency\u2019s investment amount but not the allocated computational power amount.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has an advantage under the mining as the second one requires a lot of power to run diverse crypto calculations, unlock block by block of a particular currency. The processing force converts into a high stake of power and electricity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, it was evaluated that one Bitcoin exchange required at least a whopping 1.57 American household electricity consumption per\/day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Proof of Stake algorithm looks to address this issue by crediting mining capacity to the extent of coins held by a mine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many successful crypto projects use the PoW algorithm, but many of them are planning to change their system to the PoS soon.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-pos-work\"><span id=\"how-does-pos-work\">How does PoS work?<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every PoS network can implement the algorithm in different ways; however, mainly blockchains are protected by a sort of random selection. This includes consideration of the node\u2019s wealth, coins age (the time it\u2019s being staked or locked), and the factor of randomization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In more detail, the PoS validator is constrained to validate a level of coins according to their amount of money. For example, the one who claims to have 3% of all the Bitcoin can hypothetically validate only 3 % of the blocks. This implies that the more coin or altcoin is being claimed by the validator, the more validating force this person has got.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the PoS consensus, the validator of another block is picked in a semi-arbitrary, two-step process. The main component to be considered in this choice procedure is a client\u2019s stake. Each validator must own at least one stake in the system to be suitable for the mining process.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Staking includes storing a number of tokens in the framework, securing it in a sort of a virtual safe, and then utilizing it as a guarantee to go for another block of crypto.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more a client stakes, the better their opportunity of being chosen since they\u2019d have more money in the game. But acting maliciously can result in big losses, compared to those who stake less.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"benefits\"><span id=\"benefits-of-proof-of-stake\">Benefits of Proof of Stake<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, the advantages of the PoS in contrast with the opposed algorithms are security, reduced risk of centralization, and energy efficiency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>No reason to spend huge amounts of power to verify a blockchain. For instance, It\u2019s assessed that both Bitcoin and Ethereum consume over $1 million worth of power and equipment costs every day as a feature of their accord system.<\/li><li>As a result of the absence of high power utilization, there isn\u2019t as much need to issue the same number of new coins to persuade members to continue being interested in the system.<\/li><li>The PoS mechanism is more open to a broader array of work methods. With the PoS, it\u2019s challenging to build harmful \u2018centralized cartels\u2019 like selfish mining in PoW.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Decreased centralization dangers as economies of scale are considerably less of an issue. $10 million coins will get you precisely ten times higher returns than $1 million coins, with no extra gains from the top-notch technology you can afford.<\/li><li>Better chance to avoid varieties of 51% attacks by implying economic penalties \u2013 this more expensive to carry out in such a mechanism\u2019s network.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"1380\"  height=\"480\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Benefits of PoS\"  class=\"wp-image-8331 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 1380px) 100vw, 1380px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/what-is-proof-of-stake-4-2.png\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/what-is-proof-of-stake-4-2.png 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/what-is-proof-of-stake-4-2.png 1024w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/what-is-proof-of-stake-4-2.png 768w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/what-is-proof-of-stake-4-2.png 1920w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/what-is-proof-of-stake-4-2.png 1536w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/what-is-proof-of-stake-4-2.png 2048w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/what-is-proof-of-stake-4-2.png 380w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/what-is-proof-of-stake-4-2.png 1380w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"dpos\"><span id=\"decentralized-proof-of-stake-dpos\">Decentralized Proof of Stake (DPoS)<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the development of PoS consensus, there are taking place different modifications of the algorithm.

With changing Ethereum and other platforms to Proof of Stake, we can say that the business pattern is going to end up progressively better both for the cryptomarket and the environment.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Proof-of-Stake is the second most popular consensus algorithm, which is nowadays being used by a number of successful crypto projects, with many more planning to change their system to PoS soon.\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":8256,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[14,112,1],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v14.4.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Proof of Stake (P-o-S): Explained<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Proof-of-Stake is the second most popular consensus algorithm, which is nowadays being used by a number of successful crypto projects, with many more planning to change their system to PoS soon.\" \/>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow\" \/>\n<meta name=\"googlebot\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"bingbot\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/news\/what-is-proof-of-stake\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:title\" content=\"Proof of Stake (P-o-S): Explained\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:description\" content=\"Proof-of-Stake is the second most popular consensus algorithm, which is nowadays being used by a number of successful crypto projects, with many more planning to change their system to PoS soon.\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/what-is-proof-of-stake-cover.png\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:creator\" content=\"@atomicwallet\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:site\" content=\"@atomicwallet\" \/>\n<!-- \/ Yoast SEO plugin. -->","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/740"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=740"}],"version-history":[{"count":13,"href":"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/740\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":27012,"href":"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/740\/revisions\/27012"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/8256"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=740"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=740"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=740"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
