The Bitcoin developers agreed on the need to update the protocol using the SegWit2x technology (Segregated Witness). Such a solution was proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team. It was supported by the largest mining pools from China. They agreed to update the protocol, which promised to improve the performance of the entire network. But, some of the large mining companies supported the division. So how do you think Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction will be in 2021?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result of the hard fork, there was a new coin that is called Bitcoin Cash (BCH). As commented Charles Morris, a representative of NextBlock Global investment company:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;A group of miners who did not like the option using SegWit2x decided to increase the block size of cryptocurrency from 1 MB to 8 MB&#8221;.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/3ohjUNzuqy1UCpQDfi\/giphy.gif\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"\"  width=\"514\"  height=\"289\"  class=\" pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/3ohjUNzuqy1UCpQDfi\/giphy.gif\" ><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, on August 1, the BCH was born with a block size of 8 MB. Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency, born as a fork of Bitcoin. Today Bitcoin Cash is one of the largest cryptocurrencies and takes place in Top 5 cryptocurrencies in the world. Bitcoin Cash market capitalization is about $ 2 BLN and its daily volume is about $ 200 MLN. Bitcoin Cash is also one of the value cryptocurrencies, today BCH price is about 125 USD for 1 BCH.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"market-prediction-for-bitcoin-cash-bch-price\">Market prediction for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img  loading=\"lazy\"  width=\"868\"  height=\"455\"  src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"  alt=\"Market prediction for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price\"  class=\"wp-image-14401 pk-lazyload\"  data-pk-sizes=\"auto\"  data-ls-sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\"  data-pk-src=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/hashwars.png\"  data-pk-srcset=\"https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/hashwars.png 300w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/hashwars.png 977w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/hashwars.png 768w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/hashwars.png 1920w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/hashwars.png 1536w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/hashwars.png 2048w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/hashwars.png 380w, https:\/\/atomicwallet.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/hashwars.png 868w\" ><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If the hard fork of Bitcoin Cash didn\u2019t happen in 2018, this coin could be even more perspective in the new 2019. But today there is the new coin, it\u2019s called Bitcoin SV (BSV) and there was a #HashWars for the advantages of the initial hard fork. BCH price had a hard war with BSV price for the leading position and won it. At this moment BCH price is almost twice that the BSV price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin Cash price was also bigger than today. The max BCH price was $ 4091 at the end of 2017, and its middle price for last year is about $ 400-600, so today it has the potential to grow. But in 2019, several significant news will take place on the cryptocurrency market: The US Securities and Exchange Commission will make another decision on Bitcoin ETF, start the platform for institutional investors Bakkt and Fidelity, and much more, so you should be aware of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) news if you trade it to make a profit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>#1 Wallet Investor Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction<br>BCH price may spike down to the level of $ 11 by the end of 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>#2 Smartereum Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction<br>In 5 years Bitcoin Cash price will probably be $10.000.

It is hard to tell what will happen in the long term.  Because the BCH fundamental technology is inferior to the same Ethereum or EOS. Therefore, experts recommend considering the BCH as a tool for medium-term investments (for the next year and a half).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, the BCH developers plan to provide the technical ability to enjoy the benefits of cryptocurrency to all people on the earth. They plan to develop educational projects and create charitable foundations for third world countries.
