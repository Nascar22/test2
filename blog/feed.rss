<h2 id="what-is-nem-xem"><strong>What is NEM (XEM)?</strong></h2>



<p>The New Economy Movement (NEM) is a &#8216;Smart Asset Blockchain&#8217; technology that seeks to develop a low-cost assets and data management system. NEM is a technologically-advanced blockchain that does not focus much on creating another altcoin. The platform aims to provide a means of inter-operation between private and public blockchains. Moreover, businesses can use NEM to transfer assets, including documents, tokens, and supply chains.</p>



<p>NEM.io, a non-profit organization based in Singapore, is in charge of the NEM project. In March 2015, NEM.io created NEM as a fork of NXT. NXT is another cryptocurrency and a payment network. However, NEM.io later went on to make its codebase. As a result, NEM became a hard fork, running a blockchain different from NXT. The native cryptocurrency for the NEM platform is XEM. XEM is a significant part of the futuristic NEM project.</p>



<p>As part of its unique features, NEM uses neither the proof-of-work nor proof-of-stake mechanism. There are various shortcomings to those consensus mechanisms. For example, in proof-of-work, miners with higher computing machines claim an undue advantage over miners with less-powerful computing power. Also, PoW is an energy-efficient process. Thus, it requires a stable power supply.</p>



<p>Proof-of-stake favors coin hoarders. Members who hold a large chunk of coins earn more from staking than retail holders. Moreover, proof-of-stake encourages storing or saving cryptocurrencies and not spending as it should be.</p>



<p>NEM uses the Proof-of-Importance and Harvesting mechanism. This strategy emphasizes the importance of investing in the NEM system. Participants need to have a minimum of 10,000 XEM coins vested in the network&#8217;s wallet. They will have to hold their tokens for a significant period at a 10% daily interest rate. Users can then generate new blocks and earn transaction fees. Likewise, the proof-of-importance algorithm rewards users for making transactions in the network. The system evaluates transaction amounts to boost the proof-of-importance score of users. After that, the best nodes in the network earn the most.</p>



<p>Harvesting is another crucial feature of NEM&#8217;s blockchain mechanism. The harvesting process is to replace mining. Mining is the standard process other blockchain platforms use to add new blocks to the network and validate transactions. However, like proof-of-work, mining is power-intensive and could be slow. On the other hand, harvesting only requires participants to lend their proof-of-importance score to a supernode. Supernodes instead of miners run the NEM ecosystem. Thus, users only have to connect their wallets, not particular hardware or computer.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, NEM tries to avoid participants&#8217; negligence and ensure that nodes on the system are functional. Thus, the network integrates the Eigentrust++ algorithm to balance the network load and also remove non-contributing nodes. As a result, the NEM blockchain is always efficient and uncongested.</p>



<h2 id="nem-price-chart"><strong>NEM Price Chart</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="720"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NEM-Price-Chart.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34497" ></figure>



<p>As the chart shows, the NEM coin price was once more than $2 per XEM. However, just like other cryptocurrencies, there was a massive dump in NEM price USD. At the close of 2018, the XEM price was less than $0.1. Binance listed NEM in late 2020 at about $0.1441 coin price. Since then, it has continued to increase in price. NEM current price as of this writing is 0.7350 USD.</p>



<h2 id="market-prediction-for-nem-xem-price-2021"><strong>Market Prediction for NEM (XEM) price 2021</strong></h2>



<p>The New Economy Movement (NEM) coin has fantastic properties worth discussing. However, NEM price USD has not gone back to a dollar since the massive dump in 2018. Following NEM news, the circulating supply of the coin is 8,999,999,999 XEM. Likewise, XEM total supply and maximum supply are all the same – 8,999,999,999. Thus, all XEM tokens are pre-mined and are in circulation. So, its supply might not be the reason for such a low price. XEM once had a market cap of over $14 billion. However, XEM&#8217;s current market capitalization is $6,701,987,678, with a daily trading volume of over $814,250,000.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, investors might be quite optimistic about the XEM price. The coin is number 14 on CoinMarketCap ranking, and it&#8217;s currently on over 81,000 watchlists. Does this mean traders believe in the token of the Smart Asset blockchain?</p>



<p>The XEM price chart shows an uptrend market for the coin on a daily timeframe. As said, Binance listed NEM not long ago, so this uptrend could quickly reverse. Meanwhile, the NEM coin price has a support level at $0.2 and $0.43.</p>



<h2 id="nem-predictions-2021"><strong>NEM Predictions 2021</strong></h2>



<h3 id="long-forecast-nem-price-prediction-for-2021"><strong>Long Forecast NEM Price Prediction for 2021</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="720"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Long-Forecast-NEM-Price-Prediction-for-2021.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34498" ></figure>



<p>Longforecast.com algorithm predicts NEM coin price to close at 2.47 USD by December 2021. This prediction will amount to over a 200% increase in NEM current price. Meanwhile, NEM price USD will continue to increase every month in 2021. However, according to Long Forecast&#8217;s predictions, the price increase will not last in the long run. Long Forecast predicts that XMR price will drop below $1 by 2025 as it is now.</p>



<h3 id="tradingbeasts-com-nem-predictions-for-2021"><strong>Tradingbeasts.com NEM Predictions for 2021</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="720"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tradingbeasts.com-NEM-Predictions-for-20210A.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34499" ></figure>



<p>Tradingbeasts.com has published bullish NEM news for 2021. Through the coming months in 2021, Trading Beasts predicts that NEM value will increase bit by bit. The site&#8217;s NEM predictions are realistic because volatility is inevitable in the crypto market. According to Trading Beasts expert prediction, XEM price will have a maximum of about $1 this year. However, their average NEM price prediction is different. NEM will have an average price of $0.92 in December, a minimum of $0.78, and a maximum of $1.15.</p>



<h3 id="wallet-investor-nem-price-predictions-for-2021"><strong>Wallet Investor NEM Price Predictions for 2021</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="720"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wallet-Investor-NEM-Price-Predictions-for-2021.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34500" ></figure>



<p>Wallet Investor is an expert prediction website that forecasts cryptocurrencies&#8217; prices using technical analysis and historical index. To them, XEM might be a bad investment in the next year. Their one-year prediction for the XEM coin is $0.677. However, they predict a 36% increase in NEM value within five years. Thus, by 2026, a $1,000 investment in XEM from now would yield $360 profit.</p>



<h3 id="nem-price-prediction-of-a-trading-view-analyst"><strong>NEM Price Prediction of a Trading View Analyst</strong></h3>



<p>In December 2020, an expert Trading View user, Mehdi_Rasouli94, published his NEM price chart analysis. He referred to NEM as &#8220;My favorite altcoin'&#8221; and pointed to a level around $2.5. &#8220;NEM will finally touch this line before 2022&#8221;, he wrote in his analysis. His support levels for the NEM chart lie at 0.02 USD and 0.23 USD. These two points are pivot support levels on the XEM price chart.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="720"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NEM-Price-Prediction-of-a-Trading-View-Analyst.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34501" ></figure>



<h3 id="digital-coin-nem-predictions-for-2021"><strong>Digital Coin NEM Predictions for 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Digitalcoinprice.com has predicted a relatively stagnant price movement for XEM in 2021. According to their prediction, XEM will reach $1.23 by April but will close below $1 by December. Judging by NEM current price, this prediction is realistic and achievable. Meanwhile, by 2025, Digital coin predicts that NEM price USD will be around $2.44.</p>



<h2 id="nem-price-prediction-2021"><strong>NEM Price Prediction 2021</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="720"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NEM-Price-Prediction-2021-1.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34502" ></figure>



<p>In 2021, NEM current price might increase significantly, at least over a dollar per XEM. However, there could be another sharp drop in NEM coin price. What factors might be responsible for any of these actions? The developers and management of the project continue to do more work and improve on NEM features. The update on Catapult, for example, will introduce a high-performance API gateway server with advanced scalability. Thus, the network can process more transactions per second and even facilitate messaging. Likewise, the update will enhance the easy exchange of assets within the blockchain. However, the full Catapult update is yet to launch.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, NEM Smart Asset technology has overtime seen actual use. Mijin commercial blockchain uses NEM&#8217;s technology to facilitate financial services in Japan and other places. When businesses integrate products and launch projects on the NEM platform, it also improves NEM value. When these projects succeed, they will add to the XEM use-case. NEM.io Foundation continues to do its best for the project. The Foundation ensures they introduce and educate individuals in the blockchain space about NEM&#8217;s potential. Consequently, NEM can see an international and worldwide adoption.</p>



<p>However, massive adoption can be challenging to achieve in the first few years of a project. Competition keeps growing in the blockchain ecosystem, and this could cause some setbacks for Nem.io Foundation. Other cryptocurrency projects also aim to provide solutions for smart assets and smart contracts on their networks. Examples are Waves (WAVES), Ardor (ARDR), Stratis (STRAT), and a significant stakeholder of decentralized finance, Ethereum (ETH). Remember, Ethereum is the second most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin.</p>



<p>NEM still has a long way before it can surpass some of its competitors. This setback could be terrifying NEM news. For NEM current price to pump drastically, the team needs to maintain uniqueness.</p>



<h2 id="nem-price-prediction-2025"><strong>NEM Price Prediction 2025</strong></h2>



<p>Various NEM predictions gave speculations as regards NEM coin price in the future. Meanwhile, 2025 is still a long way to go for the XEM coin, and a lot could happen between now and then. One inevitable player that can influence NEM price USD positively or the other way is Bitcoin price. Bitcoin predictions for 2025 are mostly bullish, and some experts predict a six-figure price for BTC by then. If Bitcoin should pump as hard as predicted, several altcoins, including XEM, will follow suit. Some altcoins will also increase even when the Bitcoin price remains stagnant. However, if BTC price should drop below expectations (which is not feasible), this could cause bad NEM news.</p>



<p>NEM is a futuristic project that is compatible with adoption. When released, the update on Catapult will allow it to process up to 3,000 payments per second. The adoption rate of XEM cannot be over-emphasized if its price will surge in 2025 and beyond.</p>



<p>Beyond NEM features and Bitcoin price movement, expert opinions can also drive in investors. Expert NEM predictions of Digital Coin speculates that XEM price USD will sell above $2 by 2025.</p>



<p>However, as above, Long Forecast still sees NEM value below $1 by 2025.</p>



<h2 id="nem-price-prediction-verdict"><strong>NEM Price Prediction Verdict</strong></h2>



<p>NEM has something unique to offer, and these features apply to real-world events and practical usage. The NEM platform brings Namespaces to the blockchain ecosystem. Namespaces are like domain names of websites on the World Wide Web, and therefore NEM allows users and businesses to create their domain names on the NEM network.</p>



<p>Multi-signature transactions are another feature of the NEM blockchain. Multi-signature transactions enable businesses or companies who use NEM to track the activities on their account. Thus, these businesses can expand quickly and still retain complete control of their assets. NEM&#8217;s proof-of-importance and harvesting is an added advantage as this mechanism is neither power-intensive nor expensive. All these excellent qualities of the NEM network are add-ons that could drive XEM prices higher.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, NEM has seen some other real-world applications so far, including a partnership in UAE. Also, the launch of a Blockchain Hub where NEM provides support for start-ups innovating on its blockchain.</p>



<p>On March 15, 2021, NEM will launch a new blockchain known as Symbol. The Symbol is a public blockchain, and NEM NIS1 will be migrating into Symbol after its launch. The Symbol will be a tool to connect businesses with the NEM ecosystem. The new blockchain might be the tool NEM needs to facilitate interoperability between private and public blockchains. Meanwhile, we cannot fully ascertain if Symbol is built for that yet. The token for the new Symbol blockchain is XYM. During its launch, XEM holders who opted for the XYM snapshot received XYM tokens equivalent to the XEM in their wallet.</p>



<p>The New Economy Movement (NEM ecosystem) has a vast use-case. While the NEM.io Foundation has achieved some collaborations, more adoption can still happen on the network. Adoptions, upgrades, and increases in usage are crucial to the value of XEM. Thus, XEM is a coin of the future, and it has high real-world backing. Holding XEM will be a profitable investment in 2021 and the long-term. You can manage XEM tokens using the Atomic Wallet mobile app.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-buy-nem"><strong>How to Buy NEM</strong></h2>



<p>After creating your wallet on the Atomic app, you can buy cryptocurrencies directly. Tap &#8220;BUY&#8221; in your wallet, and pay; you can pay instantly with a debit card. Payments are fast and stress-free. Temporarily, users cannot buy XEM tokens from Atomic Wallet. However, you can buy XEM from a cryptocurrency exchange and send it to your wallet. NEM is on various crypto exchanges, including top names like Binance, Upbit, OKEx, Hotbit, and many more.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-exchange-nem"><strong>How to Exchange NEM</strong></h2>



<p>Atomic Wallet users can always exchange XEM for other cryptocurrencies from their wallets. You can trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, and several others for XEM. Likewise, you can swap XEM for other coins at an excellent market rate. Ensure you download the Atomic Wallet app and create a decentralized wallet.</p>



<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>



<p>This NEM price prediction cannot be 100% accurate. However, it can give investors a clue about the investment opportunities cryptocurrencies have to offer. Before you buy a coin, please do further research and analysis.</p>



<h4 id="stellar-price-prediction-amp-forecast-2021"><strong>Stellar Price Prediction &amp; Forecast 2021</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Will Stellar (XLM) rise or fall in the 2021 calendar year?</strong></p>



<p>Stellar current price is $0.3990. It has a circulating supply of 22,571,070,030 (45% of its maximum 50 billion XLM supply). What Stellar news could drive its price in 2021? On March 2, 2021, Stellar announced the introduction of Horizon 2.0 on its Twitter page. According to the announcement, the latest development helps users deploy Horizon with fewer resources.</p>



<p>Additionally, the Grayscale Investments hedge fund has purchased a total of 35,855,625 XLM so far in 2021. This announcement is a massive one for Stellar because institutional investors are vital for any cryptocurrency value to improve. Thus, as 2021 goes by, we might see an enormous pump in Stellar price.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/THETA-PRICE-PREDICTION-2021-1918x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34491" ></figure>



<h2 id="what-is-theta"><strong>What is Theta?</strong></h2>



<p>Video streaming is all around us and in high demand. A good portion of internet bandwidth is now used to stream videos. This industry keeps growing and will only continue to grow in the coming years. However, the current centralized video streaming platforms have various inadequacies plunging their services. That is what Theta has come to solve.</p>



<p>Theta is a decentralized platform that is introducing video streaming and video content into the blockchain space. Theta has the vision to provide – Next-generation video delivery powered by everyone. Steve Chen, a co-founder of YouTube, who is also part of the Theta team, said:</p>



<p>&#8220;Theta&#8217;s innovation will disrupt today&#8217;s online video industry much like YouTube did to traditional videos back in 2005. One of our biggest challenges has been the high costs of delivering videos, and this is only getting bigger with higher quality video streams. I&#8217;m excited to be part of the next evolution of the streaming space.&#8221;</p>



<p>To achieve its vision of delivering seamless, high-quality streams up to HD and 4K resolutions at low cost, Theta is looking to bring everyone&#8217;s resources together. How? They plan to employ the unused storage and bandwidth of users on the network. Thus, there will be enough room for videos of very high resolutions while participants receive rewards for their contributions. As said, video streaming platforms like YouTube, Netflix, and Live.ly continue to grow. Major social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter even have live video options. However, these videos become blurry most times, especially in developing countries where internet service is poor.</p>



<p>Theta team is innovating a lasting solution for video delivery using distributed blockchain technology. Thus, Theta Labs have been able to build the first Decentralized Streaming Network. Theta Labs is the parent company in charge of the Theta blockchain. Jieyi Long and Mitch Liu co-founded Theta Labs in 2018. Jieyi Long has multiple experiences in gaming, virtual reality, design automation, and distributed systems. He also holds patents in virtual reality, video streaming, and blockchain technology. Likewise, Liu has multiple experiences in the entertainment industry, including co-founding THETA.tv. The very first decentralized application built on the Theta network is THETA.tv.</p>



<p>The Theta blockchain has two native tokens, Theta (THETA) and Theta Fuel (TFUEL). THETA exists as a governance token and, at launch in 2018, was a token on the ERC-20 network. Theta held a one-year-long private token sale which ended in 2018. The company was able to raise $20 million during the initial sale. However, Theta now runs its main net, and all THETA tokens use the network.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Theta Fuel (TFUEL) powers the internal economy of the Theta blockchain. The Theta blockchain uses the Proof-of-Stake financial incentive scheme to ensure its users participate in governance activities. This way, the network is secured by participants and holders of the Theta token. Also, the blockchain utilizes the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) mechanism to balance its security. The multi-level BFT also ensures faster transactions, and the network can process up to 1000 transactions per second.</p>



<p>To easily calculate user engagement with live videos, the network relies on the Proof-of-Engagement protocol. This protocol provides transparent reports of users who have watched a video and rewards them. Hence, advertisers, creators, and viewers can efficiently measure their video streaming engagement.</p>



<h2 id="theta-price-chart"><strong>Theta Price Chart</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="720"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Theta-Price-Chart.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34484" ></figure>



<p>Theta has existed since 2018. However, it became tradable on Binance in April 2019. At that time, Theta coin price was $0.135 before dumping below 10 cents a month after Binance&#8217;s listing. It was able to recover and kept on increasing in price. Theta&#8217;s current price is $4.30, and its all-time high is $4.8. In March 2020, Theta price USD was 0.03977, and this price is the coin&#8217;s all-time low. Theta coin price is still on the rise, and possibly, it will continue to reach new all-time highs.</p>



<h2 id="market-prediction-for-theta-theta-price-2021"><strong>Market Prediction for Theta (THETA) Price 2021</strong></h2>



<p>Theta&#8217;s current price, like other cryptocurrencies, is moving with the current market trend. Its all-time high is a recent price, so we may continue to have more highs if the market proves bullish. Going back, Theta price as of January 2018 was around $0.2, and it did drop significantly to as low as $0.039. However, since the Binance listing, Theta coin price continues to climb higher. Stats from various Theta news shows that the Theta project has a substantial audience in the cryptocurrency market. Theta ranks 18 among over 8,700 on the list of cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap. According to Theta&#8217;s current price chart, the coin has formed support levels at $1.84 and $2.85. Since 2021, the Theta coin price has not broken any of these pivot points.</p>



<p>Currently, Theta&#8217;s market capitalization and fully diluted cap are $4,301,936,592. THETA&#8217;s daily trading volume is over $190 million, and more than 90,000 traders have it on their watchlist. THETA coin has a circulating supply, total and maximum supply of 1 billion (1,000,000,000) tokens. THETA serves as a governance token and is distributed among the Theta network participants, including the Theta team. The Theta network also powers decentralized applications on its smart contract platform. However, developers power transactions using Theta Fuel (TFUEL). TFUEL is another token of Theta with a 5 billion total supply.</p>



<h2 id="theta-predictions-2021"><strong>Theta Predictions 2021</strong></h2>



<p>Will Theta grow or decrease in 2021? Let us discuss some expert Theta predictions.</p>



<h3 id="digital-coin-price-theta-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Digital-Coin-Price Theta Price Prediction 2021</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="720"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Digital-Coin-Price-Theta-Price-Prediction-20210A.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34485" ></figure>



<p>Digital Coin experts predict that the Theta coin price will hit $7 by 2021. Also, they endorsed the THETA coin as a profitable investment in 2021. Their THETA value speculation is about 2x of Theta&#8217;s current price. This forecast is a very realistic one as altcoins rally in price, especially during a bull run.</p>



<h3 id="wallet-investor-theta-predictions-for-2021"><strong>Wallet Investor Theta Predictions for 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Walletinvestor.com currently marks the Theta coin as an excellent investment for one year.

<h3 id="coin-bureau-theta-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Coin Bureau Theta Price Prediction 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Expert YouTube crypto-analysis channel, Coin Bureau, has given a detailed analysis of factors that will cause a pump in Theta price. He stated his viewpoint in a video made in December 2020 about the potential of Theta network&#8217;s THETA and TFUEL. According to Coin Bureau, TFUEL currently has a 5 billion token supply, but the figure is inflationary. Also, TFUEL serves as a means of payment on the blockchain, so buying pressure could keep its price down. However, THETA has a fixed non-inflationary supply with a solid use-case. Thus, THETA price has a strong bullish potential in 2021 more than TFUEL. Coin Bureau did not give a specific Theta price prediction in his video.</p>

<h3 id="previsioni-bitcoin-theta-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Previsioni Bitcoin Theta Price Prediction 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Previsionibitcoin.com is an expert price prediction website for cryptocurrencies. Previsioni Bitcoin predicts that the Theta coin price will be almost $11 by December 2021. They base this heavy boost in Theta price on the coin&#8217;s use-case. According to Previsioni Bitcoin, the Theta network and its token will receive massive attention to boost Theta news. Thus, in 2021, Theta&#8217;s value will grow more, and its capitalization will consequently increase. Of course, a coin for the very first blockchain-based video streaming platform has a strong potential.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="720"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Previsioni-Bitcoin-Theta-Price-Prediction-20210A.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34489" ></figure>



<h2 id="theta-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Theta Price Prediction 2021</strong></h2>



<p>The blockchain-based video streaming platform has some big plans to execute in the 2021 calendar year. Theta news includes some impressive roadmap the company has for 2021:</p>



<ul><li>&nbsp;The launch of a decentralized exchange on the Theta network in quarter one of 2021</li><li>&nbsp;Launch of Theta mainnet 3.0 in quarter two</li><li>&nbsp;Theta official app for Ledger and Trezor wallet also in Q2 of 2021</li><li>&nbsp;Release of Version 2 of the Edgecast Decentralized Streaming App (Dapp) – Q3 2021</li><li>&nbsp;Version 2 of the Advanced Smart Contract Developer – Q4 2021</li></ul>



<p>Theta co-founder Mitch Liu also laid out another plan for this year – the Edgecast Node platform. This platform will deliver local ingest and encoding of streams, fully decentralized streaming, chat, and event notifications. Similarly, Theta Edgecast will be the world&#8217;s first decentralized streaming Dapp for end-to-end live streaming and video delivery. According to Liu, there is a rapid growth in Theta.tv and the native cryptocurrencies of the Theta network.</p>



<p>Another exciting announcement from Theta news is the Google Chrome extension for Theta Wallet. This update is a substantial achievement because Theta has just partnered with the world&#8217;s biggest search engine. By April 20, Theta is expected to launch the THETA MAINNET 3.0, which in their roadmap is set for Q2 of 2021. This new network upgrade will introduce TFuel staking and uptime mining and burning. Participants who want to stake TFUEL will have to download the THETA Edge Node.</p>



<p>Announcements, upgrades, and improvements like these are enough to make THETA price skyrocket in 2021. Theta news is impressive, and this is enough to excite investors. No wonder THETA is on over 90,000 watchlists on CoinMarketCap. Theta is a promising blockchain project, and Theta coin price may go beyond expectations in 2021.</p>



<h2 id="theta-price-prediction-2025"><strong>Theta Price Prediction 2025</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="720"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Theta-Price-Prediction-20250A.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34490" ></figure>



<p>For all crypto assets, 2025 is still a long way. A year ago, Bitcoin&#8217;s price was much less than $10,000. However, it recently hit over $57,000 in February. Theta could do the same in the long run as a result of its unending use-case. Remember, the video streaming industry is predicted to grow immensely, especially in the coming years. So, a decentralized and low-cost video streamer like Theta will also follow the growth trend.</p>



<p>Expert prediction websites like Digital Coin are as well bullish on the long-term price of Theta. According to the Digital-coin-price algorithm, Theta price by 2025 will be up to $12 and even more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As above, Wallet Investor is also very bullish on Theta price USD future price. They provide a five-year forecast of up to a 440% increase in Theta&#8217;s current price. Thus, a $1,000 investment from now will yield a $4,400 profit by 2025. These Theta predictions are achievable by 2025.</p>



<h2 id="theta-price-prediction-verdict"><strong>Theta Price Prediction Verdict</strong></h2>



<p>The Theta project is worth the hype. Theta Labs and the team have been able to achieve meaningful partnerships. From 2018 till now, Theta is only three years old. Many cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects have been existing before Theta. However, Theta leads some of these projects in use-case, real-world usage, partnership, and coin price. Also, there is some interesting Theta news worth discussing. In December 2020, Theta started to introduce smart contracts to their Mainnet. From January 2021, Theta has added three new partnerships, including:</p>



<ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>WorldPokerTour.com</strong>&nbsp;– WorldPokerTour integrated Theta Network to launch an exclusive channel powered by Theta.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Lionsgate:</strong>&nbsp;On February 11, Theta announced that famous Hollywood filmmaking studio Lionsgate introduces its contents to Theta Network.</li><li>&nbsp;<strong>Sony Europe</strong>&nbsp;– In March 2021, Sony Europe joined the Theta Enterprise Validator program. Existing Enterprise Validator Nodes were Samsung, Google, Binance, Gumi, and Blockchain.com.</li></ul>



<p>Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of the first digital asset and cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, wanted to decentralize money and finance in general, and it was a success. Founders of Theta want to decentralize video streaming and entertainment and are becoming successful. In the next few years, when Theta fully decentralizes video streaming, Will THETA become the next Bitcoin and TFUEL the next Ethereum? The answer is only subject to time. Theta is a promising cryptocurrency, and Theta&#8217;s value might be set for new highs in the nearest future. If you find Theta a worthy crypto investment in 2021, you can manage Theta on the Atomic Wallet app.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-tezos-xtz"><strong>What is Tezos (XTZ)?</strong></h3>



<p>Arthur and Kathleen Breitman created the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/tezos-wallet" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tezos</a>&nbsp;blockchain in 2014 through Dynamic Ledger Solutions, a startup they founded to develop Tezos.</p>



<p>Some say that XTZ is somewhat similar to Ethereum because both blockchain networks feature smart contracts. Still, there are differences. Tezos boasts a far more advanced infrastructure. In other words, it doesn&#8217;t require a hard fork or changing the network&#8217;s protocol that makes previously invalid blocks and transactions valid for any upgrade. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum can&#8217;t offer the same to their users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Tezos team held an initial coin offering (ICO) in July 2017, raising the equivalent of $232 million (66,000 BTC and 361,000 ETH), the largest ICO. Following the ICO, the Tezos Foundation, based out of Switzerland, was created to launch the protocol.</p>



<p>The Tezos blockchain enables many features common to cryptocurrencies. Developers can use its software to run custom programming logic (smart contracts) and design new programs (decentralized applications) to replicate products and services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tezos can be described as secure, upgradable, and built-to-last. XTZ is an open-source platform that is said to ensure outstanding accuracy due to its smart contracts. Moreover, its staking process involves the community &#8211; people participate in governing the network by &#8220;baking.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Main Features of Tezos (XTZ) includes;</p>



<ul><li>Tezos is a self-amending decentralized platform for building dApps.</li><li>Network upgrade doesn&#8217;t require a hard fork, unlike other networks.</li><li>Tezos network confirmation is fast and cheap.</li><li>It can scale more transactions with smart contract enabled, unlike Ethereum.</li><li>&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3 id="tezos-xtz-price-chart"><strong>Tezos (XTZ) Price Chart:</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1348"  height="698"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-Chart.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34470"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-Chart.jpg 1348w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-Chart-989x512.jpg 989w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-Chart-300x155.jpg 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-Chart-768x398.jpg 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-Chart-380x197.jpg 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-Chart-800x414.jpg 800w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-Chart-1160x601.jpg 1160w"  sizes="(max-width: 1348px) 100vw, 1348px" ></figure>



<p>Making an XTZ price prediction may be difficult without assessing the token&#8217;s past performance. It helps to identify price fluctuation patterns and analyze which factors have the most significant influence. More so, Tezos news updates can affect the XTZ market movement and which will, in turn, affect the XTZ price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Tezos coin started its path with a scandal. It was launched in 2017. The ICO took place in July and was among the largest in terms of the accumulated investments. The price was average, and it was bouncing between $1.7 and slightly more than $2. Moreover, the company had to deal with a lawsuit over ICO. There were several of these lawsuits. The blame was on XTZ founders for selling unregistered assets.</p>



<p>This, of course, affected the token price. It only had started to increase and reached the $5 benchmark in December 2017, when another complaint was filed. As a result, it dropped down to $3.9 in a couple of days.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="595"  height="526"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-historical-data-2021.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34471"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-historical-data-2021.jpg 595w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-historical-data-2021-579x512.jpg 579w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-historical-data-2021-228x202.jpg 228w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-XTZ-Price-historical-data-2021-380x336.jpg 380w"  sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" ></figure>



<p>However, the collapse wasn&#8217;t disastrous. Tezos price regained its position pretty fast and exceeded the maximum price at the beginning of January 2018, reaching $5.75. No matter how promising it may have been, 2018 happened to be a complicated year for all cryptocurrencies, with constant ups and downs. As a result, XTZ ended the year at a Tezos price USD of $0.5.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What affected Tezos coin price significantly at the time was a set of regulations. Know Your Customer (KYC), and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements were introduced in summer 2018. This became a problem for XTZ as no user data was collected during the ICO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2019 after a long bearish period, Tezos value finally started to regain its value. Three-fourth of the year (from March to December) were relatively prosperous. However, all cryptocurrencies were increasing in price at the time. Tezos performed better than others. XTZ value was estimated to have risen 1,000% during the year. It climbed from 22nd position up to 10th in the cryptocurrency ranking by Coinmarketcap.</p>



<h3 id="market-prediction-for-tezos-xtz-price-2021"><strong>Market prediction for Tezos(XTZ) price 2021:</strong></h3>



<p>In 2017, the Tezos XTZ coin launch remained one of the most memorable Initial Coin Offering (ICO) to date. The scope of investment is twenty-four billion. Ever since then, the coin has been keeping a leading position in the market. For example, it&#8217;s considered one of the largest crypto, with a market capitalization of more than $2.5 billion as of late January 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The current market capitalization is $3.36 billion, while the Tezos current price trades at $4.49000 (6.87%) at the time of writing. XTZ is also the twenty-sixth largest crypto in the world by market capitalization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a total of 762,493,497 Circulating XTZ Supply and a market cap of $3,411,836,085.00 and a twenty-four-hour volume of $600,808,767.00</p>



<p>Nevertheless, it&#8217;s still early to rely on an optimistic XTZ price prediction alone. Traders are on guard because of the upcoming policy framework. Recently, the Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen said that cryptos could finance illicit activities, including terrorism. Nevertheless, she admitted that digital currencies could improve the efficiency of the financial system. This means that more regulations and policies are going to be introduced. As far as we know, they can both negatively and positively affect the price.</p>



<p>Now, let&#8217;s take a closer look at Tezos price predictions for 2021. As an overall observation, the estimations predict the XTZ coin price growth in 2021. But predictions differ in terms of scope and prediction firms.</p>

<p>TradingBeasts does justice to provide accurate price predictions for a wide range of digital coins like Tezos. They update their predictions daily, working with historical data and using a combination of linear and polynomial regressions to produce price predictions.</p>



<p>It should be noted that not everyone is optimistic about the price of a particular cryptocurrency. Trading Beasts, for example, projects a slight decrease for Tezos. According to the data provided, the price will revolve around $2.5 on average, as shown in the table above. The maximum possible, however, is $3.24.</p>

<p>Digital Coin Price has quite the same opinion about XTZ. It believes that the price will increase within a year, and investors should consider the token likely to be profitable. According to the XTZ price prediction, the Tezos price USD may be up to $4.52 in a year. It means that Tezos may double from the current value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Generally, Digital Coin Price is much more optimistic than Wallet Investor. It projects that the price will exceed $4 in February and finish the year with almost the exact figures<strong>.</strong></p>



<h3 id="tezos-coin-price-prediction-2021-nbsp"><strong>Tezos Coin Price Prediction 2021:</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In 2021, Tezos may heavily boost its price. We assume high predictable mass adoption of this cryptocurrency in months to come. We expect a Tezos rise with a strong capitalization and consequently a substantial value per coin increase.</p>



<p>As for 2022, Tezos is likely to continue in a bullish trend. Suppose the current trend of the crypto market growth will persist up to 2022. XTZ will also gain in value, at least in terms of the XTZ to fiat ratio. Potentially, it can even reach $4.89, according to Digital Coin Price. It will be the 2022 maximum that may take place in November.</p>



<p>Digital Coin Price also expects Tezos to enter a short period of recession. According to the prediction, the price will fluctuate. It may reach the overall maximum in August &#8211; $7.14</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="620"  height="972"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-Coin-Price-Prediction-2025.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34477"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-Coin-Price-Prediction-2025.jpg 620w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-Coin-Price-Prediction-2025-327x512.jpg 327w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-Coin-Price-Prediction-2025-129x202.jpg 129w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tezos-Coin-Price-Prediction-2025-380x596.jpg 380w"  sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" ></figure>



<p>The next few years are likely to be prosperous for the XTZ coin. Once again, if we are to rely on the current trends of increasing crypto adoption, as a strong altcoin, Tezos is going to bloom. We have decided to break up the long-term XTZ price prediction by year.</p>



<p>In 2021 and 2022, Tezos is highly unlikely to be in a bearish movement.</p>



<p>2023 is a controversial year in terms of predictions. For example, Trading Beasts predicts a drop in prices in the middle of the year—down to $2.15 in June, to be precise. Later, however, the Tezos coin might regain its position and return to the $3 benchmark in December 2023. Generally, such volatility is quite average for Tezos.</p>



<p>2024 is supposed to be a much better year for Tezos. Both Trading Beasts and Digital Coin Price expect the coin to rise. Trading Beasts forecasts a gradual increase: XTZ will finish the year with a value of almost $4 on average.</p>



<p>2025 is going to be even better. That&#8217;s the year when the token is supposed to hit $10, according to Digital Coin Price. However, it won&#8217;t manage to secure too high of a price. The analysts expect that XTZ will drop down to $8 each time it reaches $9-$10.</p>



<h3 id="tezos-coin-xtz-price-prediction-verdict-nbsp"><strong>Tezos coin (XTZ) Price Prediction Verdict:&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>It&#8217;s still hard to estimate the Tezos worth after ten years from now. Yet, one thing is clear: if the token remains on the market in 2030, it will have passed the test and will manage to mature. It means that it will have a reliable time-honored infrastructure and a pool of devoted users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t far-fetched, considering that XTZ developers are constantly improving the technical backup and promoting the token on the market. Therefore, it&#8217;s likely that the token will reach its overall maximum.</p>



<p>Although Tezos has already gained a significant position in the crypto market, it has already been criticized. Predominantly, of course, the critics focused on the lawsuits. Some community experts also don&#8217;t approve of the governance philosophy. In particular, Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum founder, often disagreed with the implemented policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nonetheless, experts can&#8217;t deny the benefits of the token and the technology behind it. Even Buterin admitted that it was a &#8220;well-thought-out&#8221; tech and hoped it would do well. Such a positive market sentiment is a reason to believe in an optimistic Tezos price prediction.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-cosmos-atom"><strong>WHAT IS COSMOS (ATOM)?</strong></h3>



<p>Joe Kwon founded&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/cosmos-wallet" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmos</a>&nbsp;cryptocurrency. He was a former programmer at Amazon. Joe Kwon worked with Ethan Buchman to build the Cosmos (Atom). Ethan Buchman aims to provide the community with various options for engaging in consensus-building across a wide range of industries. At the same time, Jae Kwon is the creator of the Tendermint protocol. He is passionate about promoting the Tendermint consensus algorithm, which he positions as the most efficient consensus algorithm that seeks maximum speed and scalability.</p>



<p>Together they created Tendermint in 2017, which was created to replace proof-of-work as the consensus algorithm for blockchains, which eventually turned into a company, birthing Cosmos(Atom), in march 2019, an initial coin offering (ICO). They managed to raise $17 million in less than 30 minutes of the ICO, and one ATOM was sold for $0.1</p>



<p>The Cosmos (Atom) goal is to create an &#8216;internet of blockchains&#8217; that resolves both scalability and interoperability issues in the blockchain. The Cosmos network can interact with other cryptocurrencies and applications, which other blockchain networks cannot achieve.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Price chart from trading view</em></strong></p>



<p>Cosmos (ATOM) is significantly new on the market, so many people still may not understand too much about it. It poses a complex cryptocurrency project to comprehend. Still, a vital thing to remember is that Cosmos essentially solves the scalability and interoperability problems that blockchains face today as it sits amongst the top-ranked projects.</p>



<p>Following the listing in march 2019, the Cosmos price USD started trading on exchanges with a price of $3.40 and quickly reached $5. The cryptocurrency went on to surge from April through to June as it rocketed by a total of 132% to reach the then ATH price of around $7.23 in June 2019. However, after reaching this level of resistance, ATOM rolled over and dropped by a significant 72% as it plummeted into support found in September at $1.95.</p>



<p>Many expected the price after listing at $0.4 – $0.5. However, at the peak, the cost reached $8 (80x of the ICO price). In May 2019, the Cosmos coin was added by TrustWallet. This action immediately caused the rise of the rate to $5.</p>



<p>Cosmos quickly reached an all-time high of $25.15 11 days ago. Cosmos is trading on 82 exchanges, with the top exchanges being Bitforex ($458.62M), Binance ($249.61M), and ZG.com ($233.91M). Cosmos had an all-time high of $25.15 11 days ago. Over the last day, Cosmos coin price did 13% increase in trading volume and had been trading on 205 active markets with its highest volume trading pairs being USDT ($1.47B), USD ($569.26M), and BTC ($236.46M).</p>

<p>The ATOM coin is presently priced at $17.83. The current all-time low is recorded at $16.20, with a total market cap of $4,112,709,946. Cosmos is currently ranked 19th place in the global cryptocurrency rating by coinmarketcap, with the currently available Cosmos (Atom) supply to be 210,961,968.</p>

In the past 30 days, the price of Cosmos has increased by 131.48%, while its highest values in the year time frame amount to 387.51%. The expected volatility for the next 10-15 days is still bullish.</p>



<p><strong>The XTZ current news updates suggest future adoption for the coin. News channels suggest that XTZ in the future because it is easy to upgrade block the chain network without any hard fork.</strong></p>



<h3 id="market-prediction-for-cosmos-atom-price-2021"><strong>Market Prediction For Cosmos(ATOM) Price 2021:</strong></h3>



<p>Atom price predictions are currently bullish, meaning it is a good buy for a long time Hodl. Many experts have predicted a new all-time high above its previous all-time high of $25.65. There are still Atom price predictions with facts that the ATOM value will see an all-time high above its current ATH.</p>



<p>Several projects are already being developed based on Cosmos/Tendermint technologies to make both chains interpolable, e.g., Binance Chain, e-Money, I.O.V., IRISnet, Kava, Lino, Regen Network, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The popularity of the Cosmos project is slightly associated with the events happening in coin development. According to the Google Trends graph, the highest peak occurred on April 22, when the Kraken exchange listed the ATOM coin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, Cosmos price predictions are presently bullish, though in a bear zone currently, which is a reasonable buy price, purchasing Atom at its current $17.65. Tezos coin value sometimes increases when the Tezos current news at that time positively affects its market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cosmos coin price movement reacts to Tezos&#8217; current news update at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Holding Cosmos in the long term, the target $28, $37, and $50. $50 and even $100 is not an impossible target for ATOM if the developers keep improving the system.</p>



<p>The Cosmos project has several significant technical features that allow it to achieve the goals of interaction, ranging from Scalability, Byzantine fault tolerance PoS, Cross blockchain bridges, and a decentralized exchange.</p>

<p>The Atom Coin price prediction for 2025 by most professional prediction platforms is pegged around $98. The majority predicts that if the decentralized finance (Defi) space expands into offering new types of products, the Atom coin price can triple with the Defi ecosystem&#8217;s adoption. As such, the Atom Coin price prediction by 2025-2030 is that its value has a higher possibility of surpassing its previous all-time high if the Defi space keeps expanding at this rate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, the Atom price prediction by 2025-2030 is that its value has a higher possibility of surpassing its previous all-time high. Meanwhile, a recent survey confirms that over 100 million persons are now into crypto. This will boost the Defi market capitalization by over $80 billion, according to Coingecko. More adoption and increased market capitalization will positively affect the Atom coin value.</p>

<p>Having a final verdict for the Cosmos (Atom) price prediction is impossible due to the uncertainties associated with the crypto market. Cosmos is one of the crypto coins on the Grayscale portfolios, a top cryptocurrency investment platform headed by Michael Sonnenshein.</p>



<p>Grayscale Investments, the world&#8217;s largest digital asset manager, has filed to register five new trusts for cryptocurrency assets, including ATOM and several connected to the decentralized finance (Defi) space.</p>



<p>Grayscale Cosmos Trust is solely and passively invested in Atom, enabling investors to gain exposure to Atom in the form of security while avoiding the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping Atom directly.</p>



<p>As with other trusts filed previously, the registrations were made by Delaware Trust Company on January 22nd, 2021, which is Grayscale&#8217;s statutory trustee for the US state.</p>



<p>However, the filings do not mean that trusts will necessarily be launched for the four new assets but do indicate that the asset manager is laying the groundwork for potential launching.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-neo">What is Neo?</h2>



<p>Neo is an enterprise-ready and community-driven network for the innovative economy.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/neo-wallet" rel="noreferrer noopener">NEO</a>&nbsp;is often referred to as the &#8220;Ethereum of China.&#8221; It is an open-source blockchain project that provides public blockchain services to developers and cryptocurrency investors. Translating the word Neo to Greek, it means &#8221;new&#8221;. Thus, Neo could be the more recent version of Ethereum developed in China. To set itself aside from Ethereum, Neo uses digital identity to digitize assets. Neo achieves digitization of items by creating a virtual or digital avatar for physical assets registered on its network. This avatar will have the same worth as the physical item it represents. The Neo blockchain was the first China-developed blockchain to receive approval from Chinese regulators. NEO is very flexible with its network language. Unlike Ethereum that only supports Solidity, Neo supports mainstream languages, including C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, Go, and (JS/TS).</p>



<p>Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang are the co-founders of this open network for the innovative economy. Da Hongfei is a graduate of the South Chinese University of Technology and a blockchain enthusiast. Erik Zhang, who is the brain behind the dBFT protocol, is a graduate of Shanghai University. Hongfei and Zhang founded NEO in February 2014. Meanwhile, the project was then known as Antshares with a token name of Antcoins (ANC). The team released NEO&#8217;sNEO&#8217;s whitepaper in April 2016, stating the project&#8217;s goals, development roadmap, and the technology they will utilize. The whitepaper stated the features and benefits of the Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) mechanism. Since dBFT was the first-ever consensus mechanism created in China, NEO news had massive media coverage then. In August 2016, there was an initial coin offering for NEO. The project secured over $4.5 million from the token sale—Neo Foundation better-funded Neo&#8217;sNeo&#8217;s strategies after the ICO. NEO received support from the US crypto market in 2017 after rebranding from Antshares. Bittrex listed NEO on its exchange, and a year after that, VALID also partnered with NEO. VALID is a digital identity management platform, thereby giving NEO&#8217;sNEO&#8217;s digital asset use-case a real-word usage.</p>



<p>The NEO network hosts two native tokens NEO and NEO GAS (or GAS). NEO is an investment token that also gives governance and voting rights to people who hold it. NEO GAS is a means of payment on the network; developers or businesses who create products on the blockchain pay transaction fees using GAS before they successfully launch a project.</p>



<p>NEO runs its unique consensus mechanism; the network validates transactions using the delegated Byzantine Fault Mechanism (dBFT). Distributed blockchains systems face the threat of transmission errors, network latency, and other loopholes in their security. Also, data differences and dishonest nodes may emerge on the network. While the proof-of-work protocol tries to solve these issues, PoW is rather expensive. Electricity and computational cost are enormous, likewise the need for stable internet connection. As a result, NEO proposes the delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance. This algorithm is based on the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance.</p>



<p>Per dBFT, some nodes are known as Bookkeepers, or digital accountants do the block verifications. Afterward, they broadcast the data on the blockchain. To reach a consensus, two-thirds of network nodes must agree on the new block. Advantages to this consensus mechanism are numerous. Meanwhile, the dBFT facilitates super-fast transactions up to 1,000 TPS (transactions per second).</p>



<p>In comparison, Ethereum can only handle about 12 to 15 transactions every second. Additionally, the Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance does not require computational and electricity costs like Proof-of-Work. Furthermore, the dBFT protocol helps to prevent dishonest nodes from undermining the blockchain&#8217;s efficiency.</p>



<p>In 2014, Hongfei and Zhang also worked on a blockchain project known as Onchain. Onchain is a blockchain network that provides private blockchain services for various businesses. Onchain uses the Distributed Networks Architecture (DNA) to help companies to create private blockchain networks.</p>

<p>NEO began 2021 with an uptrend. Remember, as of March 2020, the NEO coin price fell below $4, and the highest it sold for in 2020 was $26. NEO price was around $14 when the coin formed a demand candle at the beginning of 2021. Since then, the lowest NEO price USD has been $14. In 2021, the NEO price chart formed a resistance level at $55 (NEO&#8217;sNEO&#8217;s highest price in 2021 so far) and another price resistance around $43 on the daily timeframe. On the daily timeframe, Pivot support levels on NEO&#8217;s current price chart are at $43 and another at $20. In 2018, NEO was part of the massive bull run. NEO coin price went as high as $196.85, which is NEO&#8217;sNEO&#8217;s all-time high.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, NEO&#8217;sNEO&#8217;s all-time low is $0.0722. So far, $0.0722 has been NEO&#8217;sNEO&#8217;s lowest price for the past four years. The all-time low was NEO value in its early days. NEO&#8217;s current price as of this write-up is $38.45. Possibly, this price is a result of Bitcoin price dumping from $61,000 to $55,000.</p>



<h2 id="market-prediction-for-neo-in-2021">Market Prediction for NEO in 2021</h2>



<p>The growing ecosystem of Neo owns a unique native token. Neo coin is reputable and well known in the crypto space, and it ranks 38 on CoinMarketCap. Out of almost 8,800 cryptocurrencies, Neo claims 0.16% of the total market cap of crypto assets. Neo has a market capitalization of over $2.7 billion ($2,712,477,055). Likewise, Neo boasts of a daily trading volume of more than $700 million. Thus, Neo is no micro-cap asset that can be subject to pump and dump schemes.</p>



<p>The NEO coin has a definite maximum supply. The max amount of NEO that will ever be available is 100 million tokens. Meanwhile, the amount of NEO in circulation is 70,538,831. If the maximum supply of NEO were to be in circulation, then its market capitalization would be $3,845,367,177 (going by Neo value). Over 133,000 CoinMarketCap customers have NEO on their watchlists. NEO is tradable on significant cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, Huobi, Bitfinex, Kucoin, and many others.</p>

<h3 id="longforecast-neo-price-prediction-2021">Longforecast Neo Price Prediction 2021</h3>



<p>Throughout 2021, Longforecast predicts that Neo would not close at a $60 coin price. Although NEO price could go above $60, it will later fall below that mark. Neo predictions by Longforecast.com are that the coin would close around $58 by December 2021. Also, their future Neo predictions suggest that Neo value will continue to dump even in the long-term.</p>

<h3 id="wallet-investor-neo-price-prediction-for-2021">Wallet Investor Neo Price Prediction for 2021</h3>



<p>While Wallet Investor does not predict a bearish 2021 for Neo, they do not see a massive rise in NEO price this year. Wallet Investor marks NEO as an excellent cryptocurrency to hold for one year. According to Walletinvestor.com, the price forecast for Neo within a year is $44.59. Therefore, if you buy at Neo&#8217;s current price, every token you buy would yield $5 after a year.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="720"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wallet-Investor-Neo-Price-Prediction-for-20210A.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34450"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wallet-Investor-Neo-Price-Prediction-for-20210A.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wallet-Investor-Neo-Price-Prediction-for-20210A.png 910w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wallet-Investor-Neo-Price-Prediction-for-20210A.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wallet-Investor-Neo-Price-Prediction-for-20210A.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wallet-Investor-Neo-Price-Prediction-for-20210A.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wallet-Investor-Neo-Price-Prediction-for-20210A.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wallet-Investor-Neo-Price-Prediction-for-20210A.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wallet-Investor-Neo-Price-Prediction-for-20210A.png 1280w"  sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" ></figure>



<p>Additionally, Wallet Investor predicts that Neo would sell for up to $68.68 by 2026. Thus, buying $1,000 worth of Neo tokens will yield $736 profit within five-years.</p>



<h2 id="neo-price-prediction-2021-2">Neo Price Prediction 2021</h2>



<p>The 2021 calendar year is still in its first quarter. So, Neo can achieve so much from now till December. Several factors could drive Neo&#8217;s price to new highs in 2021. To avoid inflation, Neo only mines 15 million of its tokens per year. This way, if some interesting Neo news causes an increase in demand, the market won&#8217;t have to battle with supply. Also, Neo can process up to 1,000 transactions every second. Thus, the blockchain is enterprise-ready and can enable massive adoption. Firms such as Microsoft, HyperLedger, and Alibaba are investors in the Neo project. The founders of NEO are keen on gaining recognition and cooperation from the Chinese government. If this happens, Neo would be able to receive large investors from the Chinese financial market.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, there are downsides to the several advantages of Neo. As said, the founders of Neo have another project called Onchain. While Onchain serves another purpose different from Neo, its policy might have effects on Neo. Also, if Onchain seems to gain better support and partnerships, there is a possibility that the co-founders could divert their attention from Neo. Although, it might be hard to abandon Neo since it is as promising as Onchain.</p>



<p>Every month, Neo releases a statement reporting the activities of the team and developers. The report for February 2021 stated that the proposed Neo3 would soon be ready for a formal TestNet launch. The latest development about Neo3 is Preview5. This feature will introduce a domain name service compatible with traditional IP domain names &#8211; thereby making the Neo platform more user-friendly. The report stated that Neo3 TestNet should be ready to launch by late March 2021. The upgrade into Neo3 is expected to be great Neo news, which could drive Neo coin price higher.</p>



<h2 id="neo-price-prediction-2025">Neo Price Prediction 2025</h2>



<p>Neo Predictions for 2025 are both positive and negative. As it should be, some expert prediction websites predict that Neo&#8217;s price will be more than double in 2025. However, some websites forecast that there will be no massive improvement in Neo&#8217;s current price in the long-term.</p>



<p>Wallet Investor predicts that Neo will hit almost $90 by 2025. They gave a specific prediction of $68.68 Neo coin price.</p>



<p>Longforecast.com is relatively neutral on their future price forecast for Neo. Longforecast experts predict that Neo price USD will be between $39-$46 by 2025.</p>



<p>Digital Coin also has a bullish Neo price prediction. By 2025, they speculate that Neo coin price would be about 3x its current price.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="720"  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Neo-Price-Prediction-20250A.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34451"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Neo-Price-Prediction-20250A.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Neo-Price-Prediction-20250A.png 910w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Neo-Price-Prediction-20250A.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Neo-Price-Prediction-20250A.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Neo-Price-Prediction-20250A.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Neo-Price-Prediction-20250A.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Neo-Price-Prediction-20250A.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Neo-Price-Prediction-20250A.png 1280w"  sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" ></figure>



<p>Price Predictions for such a long-term can be challenging. However, as the available cryptocurrency market cap is moving towards $2 trillion, the price of crypto assets will follow the trend since they determine the market&#8217;s total value.</p>



<h2 id="neo-price-prediction-verdict">Neo Price Prediction Verdict</h2>



<p>Neo is a thriving network that is rapidly growing and developing. The Neo Foundation, formerly known as Neo Council, has secure partnerships for the blockchain service. Also, decentralized applications, smart contracts, and other exciting products are emerging on the network. Developments like these will enable Neo to reach its goal to become the next-generation internet.</p>



<p>Recently, NEO announced its partnership with the upcoming DigiFinex Cryptocurrency debit card. This card will provide customers with the ability to make payments with NEO and other cryptocurrencies through UnionPay. This development is to launch on March 30, 2021. Meanwhile, UnionPay is one of the world&#8217;s largest PIN-network.</p>



<p>Likewise, on March 15, FiCAS ETP, a firm that trades on the Swiss SIX Exchange, received the visit of a representative of the Neo Blockchain. According to Neo&#8217;sNeo&#8217;s official Twitter handle, the visit was to encourage institutional adoption of digital assets. Meanwhile, we do not know if this visit would lead to a partnership.</p>



<p>Neo is a platform that provides blockchain-based enterprise solutions and enables intelligent contract development. Currently, there is an EcoBoost program to power up the success of products looking to launch on the Neo platform. Neo will invest up to $100 million in various blockchain solutions through the EcoBoost program.</p>

Therefore, investors can be sure that the project is here to stay. Crypto traders who wish to hold NEO can do so on Atomic Wallet. Atomic provides a decentralized Wallet for buyers to store and manage NEO tokens.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-buy-neo">How to Buy NEO</h2>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://dev.atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VECHAIN-PRICE-PREDICTION-2021-1918x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34440" ></figure>



<h2 id="what-is-vechain-vet"><strong>What is VeChain (VET)?</strong></h2>



<p>VeChain is a blockchain establishment that aims to strike a balance between centralization and decentralization. VeChain has a goal to efficiently and transparently decentralize supply-chains of businesses. Over time, trained professionals have been handling supply-chain management and then giving reports to companies. However, some of these professionals become corrupt and fraudulent, especially when dealing with luxury goods. As a result, counterfeit items have cost the luxury industry billions of dollars. Hence, the founders of VeChain deem it fit to adopt the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for tracking the supply of goods. Each product is given a unique identity using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). Smart chips on each item will record whatever happens throughout the supply chain. Afterward, the RFID will publish this information to the blockchain platform, and authorized individuals can access it.</p>



<p>Sunny Lu and Jay Zhang co-founded VeChain back in 2015 before the service became official in 2016. Sunny Lu was the Chief Information Officer (CIO) of Louis Vuitton China before he started VeChain. Louis Vuitton is a fashion brand that majorly produces expensive clothing. No wonder Lu was inspired to launch a blockchain network that aims to solve the problems of supply-chain. The company began as a subsidiary of Bitse, a prominent blockchain company in China. In 2017, VeChain held a crowd sale for its cryptocurrency (known as VEN by then) as a token on the Ethereum blockchain. Back then, Vechain used to operate as VEN, and its cryptocurrency was the VEN token. VeChain sold one billion VEN tokens during the distribution, and this amounted to $20 million. The VeChain Foundation operates the VeChain ecosystem and VeChainThor blockchain. The Foundation ensures transparency within the ecosystem.</p>



<p>VeChain rebranded from VEN in 2018 and started its VeChainThor (VET) blockchain. Consequently, VET tokens replaced VEN, and the team had to import all tokens to the VeChainThor blockchain at a 1:100 ratio. Currently, the VeChainThor blockchain hosts two native cryptocurrencies – VET and VTHO. VET is the cryptocurrency that powers the network and is for sending, staking, and holding. Meanwhile, VTHO serves as means by which businesses pay to build decentralized applications on the Vechain network.</p>



<p>VET has a fixed supply, and its price is subject to demand. However, to ensure that developers and businesses pay stable network fees, VTHO supply is occasionally adjusted to sustain a stable price. Also, in case of a wrong transaction fee estimate, the blockchain provides a Proof of Work option. Thus, developers can mine more VTHO to pay their fees.</p>



<p>Several blockchains have come up with new governance protocols different from Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-stake. Vechain is not left behind. The VeChainThor blockchain adopts a unique consensus mechanism known as Proof of Authority (PoA). Per proof-of-authority, participants hold governance and voting rights based on how many VET tokens they hold. There are 101 Authority Masternodes that verify transactions on the blockchain. Authority Masternodes include enterprise users, academic research partners, community contributors, and other stakeholders. These stakeholders must hold a minimum of 25 million VET tokens. Moreover, the VeChain Foundation has to verify participants who wish to become Masternodes.</p>



<p>VET holders can also obtain voting rights. Although, they need to hold at least 1 million VET tokens. Participants who have verified their know-your-customer (KYC) credentials have 30% voting power. However, unverified individuals with up to 1 million VET coins only receive 20% voting rights. VeChain wants to bring transparency into supply-chain management; thus, it has to ensure transparency in its system. Thus, there are no anonymous nodes in the VeChainThor network.</p>



<p>Per VeChain&#8217;s goal, the proof-of-authority mechanism is an excellent choice. It does not require computational power, neither does it need a lot of confirmations. However, there are shortcomings to the protocol VeChain runs. For example, proof of authority does not retain absolute decentralization. There is a need for verification of participants on the network. Also, power is centralized to individuals who hold a large chunk of VET tokens.</p>

<p>After the initial coin offering of 2017, Binance listed Vechain in July 2017. The VeChain price during the Binance listing was around $0.025. It didn&#8217;t maintain this price as it fell below $0.01 in August 2018. Since then, VET price has been crawling, and not until January 2021 did it hit $0.025 (Price as at Binance listing) again. As of this writing, the VET price was at its peak, with an all-time high of $0.072 on March 12, 2020. Thus, VeChain&#8217;s current price could be its all-time high as the coin seems to be experiencing an uptrend. A year ago, on March 13, 2020, the VeChain coin price dumped to $0.00168, which is its all-time low. VeChain&#8217;s current price during this write-up is $0.07.</p>



<h2 id="market-prediction-for-vechain-vet-2021"><strong>Market Prediction for VeChain (VET) 2021</strong></h2>



<p>On the daily time frame, VeChain&#8217;s current price chart has formed price support around $0.0376, $0.024, and $0.01. Meanwhile, the $0.0376 and $0.024 support are very recent price levels that VeChain price formed in 2021. VeChain coin price continues to sustain the $0.01 support level since 2020. The movement of the general cryptocurrency market is significant to determine where VeChain coin price is heading. Also, BTC dominance is essential as it claims more than 60% of the total market. Thus, a slight movement in BTC price can reverse the market trend at any time.</p>



<p>VeChain is a popular crypto asset. It ranks 20 on the list of almost 8,800 cryptocurrencies. Also, VeChain is a coin on over 200,000 watchlists on CoinMarketCap. VeChain has a maximum and total supply of 86,712,634,446. The circulating supply of VET is 64,315,576,989 (74% of its max amount). While VET has a specific maximum, its circulating supply will increase as VeChain news sees more adoption. VET has a market capitalization of over $4 billion. Meanwhile, going by VeChain current price and its maximum supply, VET has a diluted market cap of $5,978,653,300. However, the fully diluted market cap is subject to a price change, while the market cap is subject to movement in price and an increase in circulating amount.</p>



<p>Currently, VeChain has a daily trading volume of over $1.1 billion. Thus, VET is not a micro-cap coin, and it has a strong base in the cryptocurrency market. Remember, the VeChainThor blockchain has two native tokens. These in-house tokens are VET and VTHO (VeChainThor Energy). VET has a fixed supply. However, we cannot determine the maximum amount of VTHO due to the purpose it serves on the network. By staking VET, investors can generate some income in VTHO. However, to avoid an infinity supply, 70% of VTHO paid in transaction fees is frequently burnt.</p>

<h3 id="digital-coin-price-vechain-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Digital-Coin-Price VeChain Price Prediction 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Digital Coin prediction website is not very bullish on their VeChain price prediction. Their VeChain price prediction for December 2021 is $0.095. This forecast is just about a $0.03 increase from VeChain current price. Meanwhile, Digital-Coin-Price also predicts that VeChain price USD would reach $0.109 by August 2021 before it dumps to their December prediction.</p>

<h3 id="trading-beasts-vechain-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Trading Beasts VeChain Price Prediction 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Trading Beasts VeChain predictions for 2021 are as well neutral. Experts of this price prediction website do not foresee a massive increase in VET price this year. The average price prediction they have for December 2021 is $0.087. However, the maximum price they predict for VeChain in 2021 is attractive. From April to December, Tradingbeasts.com predicts that VeChain will have a maximum price of up to $0.01.</p>

<h3 id="wallet-investor-vechain-predictions-2021"><strong>Wallet Investor VeChain Predictions 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Wallet Investor marks VET as an excellent or profitable one-year investment. Their one-year VeChain price prediction is $0.09. Meanwhile, Wallet Investor is very bullish on their long-term VeChain predictions. According to tradingbeasts.com, VET prices will increase by over 260% in the next five years. Thus, investing $1,000 in VeChain now will yield more than $2,000 by 2026.</p>

<p>While Wallet Investor&#8217;s prediction is not very bullish for this year, their VeChain current price indicator shows that bulls have taken control of the VeChain market. Thus, selling pressure could take over anytime.</p>



<h3 id="bitboy-crypto-vechain-predictions-for-2021"><strong>BitBoy Crypto VeChain Predictions for 2021</strong></h3>



<p>In a YouTube video of February 2021, BitBoy stated why we could experience 20 times VeChain current price in 2021. His analysis was majorly fundamental, and it is based on VeChain&#8217;s use-case and partnerships. The YouTube crypto analyst expressed his belief in VeChain as a network with almost no competitor within the blockchain space. As VeChain aims to change the future of logistics, the team is organizing partnerships, expanding in China and even to the West. Likewise, the VET token is growing to become a payment solution for the supply chain management.</p>

<h3 id="mind-math-vechain-predictions-2021"><strong>Mind Math VeChain Predictions 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Mind Math is an expert YouTube crypto analyst. His VeChain price prediction was based on technical analysis of previous VET price action. He stated pivot resistance levels around $0.06 before VET crashed by 40% and now is regaining strength. Meanwhile, he also marked support points on the daily timeframe around $0.4. Mind Maths pointed out various technical factors which might be crucial to determine VET price movement in 2021. However, he didn&#8217;t give a definite VeChain value prediction.</p>

<h2 id="vechain-price-prediction-2021"><strong>VeChain Price Prediction 2021</strong></h2>



<p>As above, VeChain is a project with practical usage. VeChainThor is a public blockchain that derives value from projects its members create. Thus, developers who build decentralized applications on the VeChainThor network add to VeChain value. To promote VeChainThor, VeChain Foundation has set up programs to educate developers about the network. Examples of these resources are:</p>



<ul><li>&nbsp;Lively Boot Camp for the VeChain community</li><li>Application Hub – where VeChainThor users can explore the information on the blockchain</li><li>A Developer Info Center – here programmers can find documents and guides to develop Dapps</li><li>Bounty Programs where projects built on the blockchain receive support from the VeChain community</li><li>VeResearch – this includes VeChiain&#8217;s research and academic papers. Likewise, their published technical write-ups.</li><li>VeVote – users and nodes vote on solutions to ensure the VeChainThor blockchain remains anonymous and impossible to manipulate.</li></ul>



<p>While VeChain might have a reasonable use-case for its project, it is uncertain that many businesses will buy into their idea. Installing and managing RFID tags, smart chips, and other supply chain management devices might be expensive. As a result, companies that move a tremendous amount of goods will find it hard to pay for the items and labor costs. If VeChain cannot decentralize information within the supply chain, this could cause a hard time for VET value.</p>



<p>Within 2021 it is possible to see a reasonable spike in VET price. The VeChain Foundation is doing its best to achieve publicity for the project. Also, VeChainThor is a solution-based blockchain and not just a way to decentralize money. Like VeChain predictions of expert websites, VeChain price USD could reach $0.1. However, this prediction might be subject to general movements of the crypto market and Bitcoin price.</p>



<h2 id="vechain-price-prediction-2025"><strong>VeChain Price Prediction 2025</strong></h2>



<p>VeChain does not limit itself to the blockchain space. As the world continues to embrace technology and easier ways of doing things, VeChain will not be left behind. If VeChain targets developing markets like Africa, investors could find their supply chain concept interesting. Remember, Africans are gradually adopting the blockchain idea, especially to escape inflation of their currencies. VeChain value could reach one dollar or more by 2025 if it sustains more partnerships and product launches on VeChainThor.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, expert prediction sites like Digital coin predicted that VeChain price USD would only reach $0.2 by 2025.</p>



<p>Likewise, Wallet Investor predicts that VeChain price USD would be up to $0.24 by 2026. This forecast is a feasible prediction for the next five years.</p>



<h2 id="vechain-price-prediction-verdict"><strong>VeChain Price Prediction Verdict</strong></h2>



<p>VET has a lot of fundamental backings. As a Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) network, VeChainThor is pushing adoption and encouraging product launch because it is vital to any blockchain. If the team can secure as many products on the network, they can be sure of investments that will trigger VeChain value. According to VeChain news on their official blog, VeChain has secured numerous partnerships and is open for more.</p>



<p>Recently, PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC), an accounting and business advisory firm, bought shares in VeChain. PwC is looking to integrate the VeChain module to deliver a trust-free service within the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem.</p>



<p>Similarly, Vechain partnered with Jiangsu Electronics, a Chinese Company. The company will develop RFID chips that will ensure proper tracking of supply chain information.</p>



<p>Likewise, car producers like Renault have integrated VeChain for their manufacturing operations. BMW also uses VeChain to prevent odometer fraud in sales of its cars.</p>



<p>Moreover, Walmart China currently uses VeChain&#8217;s technology to ensure the safety of food during transit.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Renji Hospital in China also announced its plan to launch the world&#8217;s first Intelligent Tumor Treatment Center in October 2020. The medical management solution will be based on VeChain&#8217;s blockchain network.</p>



<p>Within and beyond blockchain, VeChain news is being spread wide. VeChain is the first five-star company to receive the TUV Saar Blockchain Service Certification. VeChainThor might still be in its early days of adoption and development. Therefore, VeChain value in 2021 and coming years will be mind-blowing. Investors who wish to add VET to their cryptocurrency portfolio can do that on Atomic Wallet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While the concept of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can be traced back to 2012, it&#8217;s only recently that they&#8217;ve garnered sustained attention from the mainstream media.</p>



<p>This has occurred as they&#8217;ve skyrocketed in popularity of late, with several high-profile sales having taken place through February and March this year. An original Banksy was recently burnt and destroyed as part of a viral live-streamed video before being&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56335948" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold via an NFT that represented the work for $380,000</a>.</p>



<p>In February, a classic LeBron James clip was sold in NFT form for $99,000, while a looping video clip iteration also changed hands for $26,128 around the same time.</p>



<p>This represents just the tip of the iceberg for NFTs, which have evolved considerably since their inception nine years ago.&nbsp;<strong><em>But what exactly is an NFT, and what are its most prominent use cases?</em></strong></p>



<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-non-fungible-tokens">A Brief History of Non-Fungible Tokens</h2>



<p>At its core, an NFT is simply a unique and non-interchangeable digital asset whose ownership is recorded on a blockchain. The word &#8216;fungible&#8217; means interchangeable, so assets categorized as NFTs simply cannot be exchanged as like-for-like entities on any particular network.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that virtually any piece of digital content can be minted into an NFT, from iconic Banksy artwork to songs and famous tweets. The scope and potential use cases for NFTs remain virtually endless. To this end, Twitter founder Jack Dorset recently put his first-ever tweet (from March 21st, 2006) up for auction in the form of an NFT. Bidding has already&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/jack-dorsey-posted-the-first-tweet-15-years-ago-now-its-selling-as-an-nft-3560699.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached $2.5 million at the time of writing</a>.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll further detail how NFTs work later in the piece, but arguably the first iteration of this technology existed in the form of colored coins. Colored coins were first discussed in a 2012 blog post written by Yoni Assia, with these entities consisting of small denominations of a single Bitcoin (BTC) token. Colored coins subsequently represented several assets across various use cases, including property, coupons, and company shares. Despite their complex nature, they represented a huge evolution in Bitcoin&#8217;s capabilities, while they also laid the foundation for the modern NFTs that we see replicated today. This partly inspired the launch of Counterparty in 2014, which was formed as a peer-to-peer financial platform and distributed an open-source protocol developed on top of the original Bitcoin blockchain. This allowed for asset creation within a decentralized exchange, while it also housed the first-ever game (Spells of Genesis) to issue in-game assets onto a blockchain in April 2015.</p>



<p>Similar projects followed as the concept of NFTs grew in popularity, although it wasn&#8217;t until October 2017 that it began to hit the mainstream. At this time, &#8216;CryptoKitties&#8217; was launched on Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain network, with this described as a blockchain-based virtual game that enabled players to adopt, raise, and trade virtual cats in the form of NFTs.</p>



<p>Coinciding with Bitcoin and the crypto market&#8217;s infamous bull run of 2017, the launch of this unique project hit the headlines, even featuring on mainstream news sites such as CNN. This was largely due to the relatively high profits available through trading. Simultaneously, the immense success and popularity of the game caused many to realize the full potential of leveraging NFTs.</p>



<p>Before this years&#8217; explosion of non-fungible token sales, 2018 and 2019 also saw considerable exponential growth within the NFT ecosystem. During this time, more than 100 high-profile projects were initiated. However, it&#8217;s fair to say that the trade volumes for NFTs and similar assets remained small about alternative cryptomarket niches.</p>



<p>Still, the market for selling NFTs as a digital representation of iconic artwork has exploded of late, with YouTube personality Logan Paul making more than $5 million selling such assets over two days as recently as February 2021.</p>



<p>Overall, it&#8217;s thought that musicians have now sold more than $4 million in NFTs throughout the global industry, with this number likely to increase exponentially in the near, medium, and long-term. We&#8217;ll explain why this may be the case a little later on.</p>



<h2 id="how-do-non-fungible-tokens-work">How Do Non-Fungible Tokens Work?</h2>



<p>As we&#8217;ve already touched on, digital content and records can be &#8216;minted&#8217; into NFTs, with this referring to the process of creating a unique file that exists on a particular blockchain.</p>



<p>In this process, the blockchain acts as a decentralized ledger that records and tracks each NFT while simultaneously displaying the associated transaction history. This data is subsequently coded to have a unique ID and other forms of metadata that no other NFT can replicate, creating a unique and immutable digital record that third parties cannot manipulate.</p>



<p>The software programs used to code non-fungible tokens are referred to as smart contracts, which are central to contemporary blockchains&#8217; appeal and can govern fundamental aspects such as the transfer and ownership of established NFTs. Like the vast majority of software and blockchain applications, NFTs can also be programmed far beyond ownership and transferability concepts. This allows individuals to access far greater functionality, including the capacity to link a particular NFT to an alternative type of digital asset.</p>



<p>Thanks to this transparent, immutable, and ultimately scalable process, NFTs are afforded scarce and originality attributes. This makes them particularly attractive when paired with digital media, while it also allows unique assets (such as Banksy artwork) to be replicated by NFTs without losing their inherent value. In this instance, a human asset is simply transferred into a digital one, with the value subsequently moved seamlessly onto the remaining NFT.</p>



<h2 id="why-non-fungible-tokens-are-all-the-hype-today">Why Non-Fungible Tokens are all the hype today</h2>



<p>Given that the history of NFTs can be traced back to 2012, the question that remains is why non-fungible tokens are all the hype today?</p>



<p>The first observation is that the diverse realms of gaming, art, and music have become increasingly digitized in recent times, both in terms of development and distribution. As a result, they&#8217;re increasingly compatible with the technology underpinning NFTs, creating an easy-to-understand and more appealing proposition for investors and artists.</p>



<p>From the sole perspective of artists, of course, the proliferation of NFTs provides a unique opportunity for them to sell their content in a completely novel and unique way. As a result, they can arguably sell even mediocre content at a price premium while simultaneously accessing free and often viral marketing through social media and traditional news networks.</p>



<p>Remember, NFTs also boast a tangible sense of scarcity and a traceable real-world link, which automatically increases the asset&#8217;s value while creating a new and exciting outlet for speculative money. Similarly, NFTs allow for quick and secure transactions that leverage the unique advantages of blockchain technology, with this particularly appealing for those whose motivation is grounded in getting rich quickly without compromising on the viability of individual transactions.</p>



<p>Of course, the newest surge of NFT sales is seeing people pay tens of thousands for assets that would otherwise arguably be freely available on social media. Such assets can include memes and animated gifs, with one particular animated cat altered to include a dogecoin token recently selling online for $69,000.</p>



<p>In this case, the NFT assets don&#8217;t boast any inherent value or real scarcity, so their popularity is a little harder to explain. This is until you begin to understand how hype itself continues to drive the market for NFTs, with this generating a significant buzz that draws attention to the wider crypto marketplace and the unique technology that underpins it.</p>



<h2 id="non-fungible-token-use-cases">Non-Fungible Token Use Cases</h2>



<p>As we&#8217;ve already seen, art and musical content have dominated the NFT niche, with aspects such as creation, copyright, and ownership highly important and lucrative within these spaces.</p>



<p>However, there are other prominent (albeit less obvious) use cases for non-fungible tokens, including the following:</p>



<h3 id="the-gaming-industry">The Gaming Industry</h3>



<p>As digital games such as CryptoKitties highlight, there has always been an affinity between gaming and NFT technology.</p>



<p>Certainly, the gaming industry has spent much of the last decade creating virtual economies within an individual game&#8217;s ecosystem. This is underpinned by the type of freemium model that characterizes World of Warcraft (WoW) Fortnite.</p>



<p>In the case of blockchain-based titles, NFTs enable players to trade in-game collectibles securely and in real-time while also guaranteeing authenticity and allowing for fully verified transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, gaming-related NFTs work similarly to some cryptocurrency networks, particularly as users can participate in their governance and offer input into discussions on future development within a particular game&#8217;s ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="sports">Sports</h3>



<p>There are various transaction challenges faced by fans across a diverse array of sports, from the sale of historic memorabilia without provenance to counterfeit merchandise and tickets&#8217; widespread deployment.</p>



<p>Make no mistake; using NFTs and blockchain technology can help eliminate these issues, as their immutable and transparent nature prevents counterfeit collectibles or tickets from being sold.</p>



<p>One iteration of this would see unique and tokenized game tickets issued directly on the blockchain network, providing a practical use case for NFTs while enabling buyers to protect themselves at all times. While each game ticket may be similar, every entity will be defined by unique identifiable information that connects it to the designated owner on the blockchain.</p>



<p>Going forward, it&#8217;s thought that sporting merchandise could ultimately be represented by NFTs, allowing the owner to register and verify official items as theirs.</p>



<h3 id="real-estate">Real Estate</h3>



<p>Real estate represents a slightly different use case for non-fungible tokens, while it is also one of the most interesting types of projects in the marketplace. In this example, a single property is fractionated into multiple assets, subsequently purchased by investors on a blockchain-based exchange network. This allows for collaborative ownership of individual properties, while it also provides a seamless and simplified transaction process whether you&#8217;re buying or selling a house. Most importantly, this eliminates the need for a third-party intermediary, potentially lowering the cost of buying and selling homes in the process.</p>



<p>By deploying NFTs as a form of smart contract, sellers can also minimize the risk of conflict or legal disputes about land ownership or a particular estate.</p>



<h3 id="erc-721-vs-erc-1155-vs-non-fungible-tokens-comparison">ERC-721 vs. ERC-1155 vs. Non-Fungible Tokens Comparison</h3>



<p>When titles such as Cryptokitties were first created on the Ethereum blockchain, developers sought out ways to enhance the standard of gaming through this medium. To this end, non-fungible tokens were developed using the ERC721 standard, which created a formal template that other participating developers agreed to follow from the outset.</p>



<p>However, we live in the age of third-generation blockchains, some of which offer similar functionality to Ethereum and have evolved the concept of decentralized gaming. As a result of this, Enjin has created a newer and approved Ethereum token standard, with this referred to as ERC1155.</p>



<h4 id="but-what-are-the-differences-between-these-standards-nbsp">But what are the differences between these standards?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Well, ERC-721 is limited to non-fungible tokens only, whereas the ERC1155 standard also makes allowances for fungible and interchangeable assets such as crypto tokens.</p>



<p>Currently, the ERC-721 standard only supports the transfer of a single token or asset at a time, while ERC1155 allows for much larger batch transfers that include numerous token IDs as part of a single transaction. Given that each Ethereum transaction takes between 15 and 30 seconds to complete attempting to transfer numerous ERC-721 tokens at once can be incredibly time-consuming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to smart contracts, ERC-721 assets require a separate and unique contract for every token iteration. However, ERC-1155 tokens can be deployed in a single, smart contract for infinite token and asset types, affording users far greater flexibility and autonomy when creating agreements between parties.</p>



<h3 id="the-10-most-famous-non-fungible-tokens-so-far">The 10 Most Famous Non-Fungible Tokens (So Far!)</h3>



<p>We&#8217;ll close with a list of the ten most famous and lucrative NFT transactions of all-time, highlighting the immense appeal and popularity of this asset class and how it exploded of late.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="these-include">These include:</h4>



<p><strong>10. Nyan Cat by Chris, on Foundation ($590,000):&nbsp;</strong>This featured the popular piece of Internet folklore called the Nyan cat meme, which sold for $590,000 (or 300 ETH) in February 2021.</p>



<p><strong>9. The Complete MF Collection by Beeple, on Nifty Gateway ($777,777.77):&nbsp;</strong>This unique NFT transaction combined blockchain-based art with an original, physical component and sold for a premium earlier this year.</p>



<p><strong>8. Hairy by Steve Aoki, on Nifty Gateway ($888,888.88):&nbsp;</strong>Similarly, musician Steve Aoki collaborated with Antoni Tudisco to produce a combination of the former&#8217;s music and a blue-and-purple figure while sold for a huge and rather specific sum of money.</p>



<p><strong>7. Not Forgotten, But Gone by WhlsBe, on Nifty Giveaway ($1 million):&nbsp;</strong>This 16-second video clip of a spinning, gold skeleton gummy bear was another sell recently on the Nifty Gateway platform and managed to reach the $1 million mark.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-iota-miota"><strong>What is IOTA (MIOTA)?</strong></h2>



<p>IOTA is a cryptocurrency project that does not run on a blockchain. Instead, IOTA uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure which they call Tangle. IOTA aims to develop a mode of communication within the&nbsp;<strong>Internet of Things&nbsp;</strong>(IoT) ecosystem. IOTA uses the Tangle mechanism to store and process transactions for free. Free in the sense that it can successfully process microtransactions. Remember, a setback of the Bitcoin network is that it cannot process micro-transactions due to transaction fees. Bitcoin has to pay miners who confirm transactions on the blockchain. However, all MIOTA tokens have been pre-mined. Pre-mining of MIOTA coins could have as well caused an increase in transaction fees. However, IOTA uses the Tangle mechanism to confirm transactions.</p>



<p>IOTA solves scalability problems by forcing a transaction issuer to approve two previous transactions. What does this mean? If user C wants to transfer some MIOTA tokens, he can confirm users A and B&#8217;s transactions. So, when next A and B wants to make a MIOTA payment, they have to validate two other transactions. Hence, no miners confirm transactions, and there is no need for high transaction fees. Due to the increase in use, some blockchains like<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/bitcoin-scaling-problem-explained" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Bitcoin</a>&nbsp;might develop congestion and become slower. However, the kind of mechanism Tangle will require more and more users. Thus, this protocol can help solve the congestion issues that blockchains might soon develop.</p>



<p>IOTA dates back to 2014 but was known as the Jinn project then. It was a hardware project that intends to produce general-purpose processors that are less expensive. In September 2014, there was a crowd sale for the Jinn token where the ICO sold out 100,000 coins. However, Jinn rebranded to IOTA in 2015. Co-founders of IOTA are Serguei Popov, Dominik Schiener, Sergey Ivancheglo and David Sønstebø. IOTA Foundation is a non-profit organization in charge of the IOTA project. The IOTA foundation is based in Germany and works to extend utility for the MIOTA token.</p>

<h2 id="market-prediction-for-miota-price-2021"><strong>Market Prediction for MIOTA Price 2021</strong></h2>



<p>Since July 2018, MIOTA&#8217;s price has fallen below $1, and it closed around $0.31 in 2020. However, in February 2021, the IOTA price increased to $1 once again. IOTA&#8217;s current price is $1.12 with a trading volume of over $149 million. Its current market capitalization is $3,113,286,900 and it ranks 25 on CoinMarketCap. IOTA has a circulating supply of 2,779,530,283. As said, all IOTA coins have been pre-mined. As a result, its maximum supply is the same as its circulating supply (2,779,530,283 MIOTA tokens). You can trade IOTA on top cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, OKEx, HitBTC, and Upbit.</p>



<p>Three years ago, the IOTA coin price had an all-time high of $5.69. However, in March 2020, MIOTA&#8217;s price dropped drastically to $0.0796. What a massive dump in price! Meanwhile, it was quick to recover as IOTA price USD is now above $1. Currently, the IOTA price support level lay around $0.8. However, market volatility might break this support level.</p>



<h2 id="iota-predictions-for-2021"><strong>IOTA Predictions for 2021</strong></h2>



<p>IOTA has a good potential and an excellent use-case in the Internet of Things ecosystem. However, expert IOTA predictions and algorithm forecasts about IOTA value might differ. Let us review some IOTA news for 2021.</p>



<h3 id="martin-palamarz-iota-predictions-2021"><strong>Martin Palamarz IOTA Predictions 2021</strong></h3>



<p>While replying to Elon Musk&#8217;s tweet, Martin Palamarz expressed his belief in IOTA. Palamarz said blockchain had caused a trilemma due to lack of scalability and cost of transactions. However, what IOTA is designing will soon solve these issues. IOTA will deliver free payments and the most decentralized DLT.</p>



<p>&#8220;The thing we call money is just an information system for labor allocation,&#8221; Elon Musk, CEO Tesla.</p>



<p>Martin Palamarz thinks Elon Musk should look out for IOTA and invest in the project.</p>

<h2 id="iota-price-prediction-2021"><strong>IOTA Price Prediction 2021</strong></h2>



<p>The above IOTA predictions of expert websites all sit below $2 in 2021. Various events could positively or negatively affect IOTA price prediction. IOTA is looking to develop a real-world use-case for the MIOTA token. Thus, it has added some impressive partnerships to boost MIOTA&#8217;s adoption. Currently, IOTA is in collaboration with companies like Volkswagen, Samsung, and Cisco. It also wants to develop ID cards based on Tangle for people living in Taipei. The Internet of Things to which IOTA is directing its work is growing too. Expenditures in the IoT ecosystem should increase to over $260 by 2021. This adoption can boost IOTA value and also increase MIOTA price.</p>



<p>Other cryptocurrencies that run on blockchains are developing scalability problems due to adoption. However, IOTA uses Tangle technology, and Tangle&#8217;s design supports rapid growth in use. So, for MIOTA, adoption is not a problem. Real-world partnership, the Internet of Things, and scalability are blessings to IOTA value; what are its pitfalls?</p>



<p>IOTA&#8217;s technology, Tangle, is still a work in progress, and there are shortcomings in its development. For example, Tangle might not be able to record transactions in the correct order. Likewise, Tangle might be prone to the activities of hackers. Apart from Tangle&#8217;s problems, IOTA competitors like the IoT Chain also pose a threat to MIOTA price. Competitors might gain a stand in the market and claim IOTA&#8217;s audience. If this happens, the IOTA coin price might continue to struggle within the $1 range.</p>



<h2 id="iota-price-prediction-2025"><strong>IOTA Price Prediction 2025</strong></h2>



<p>Generally, there is a hype of the cryptocurrency market. This hype can also affect IOTA news positively. Billionaire investors, including Elon Musk, have developed an interest in crypto assets. Likewise, investment companies, hedge funds, and family offices are buying into crypto now. This development is good news not only for the crypto market at large but also for IOTA.</p>



<p>Major crypto prediction websites are bullish on IOTA price USD for the long-term. 2025 is still a long way for IOTA. Meanwhile, Digital Coin predicts that MIOTA price will be up to $3.75 in 2025.</p>



<h2 id="our-verdict-on-iota-price-prediction"><strong>Our Verdict on IOTA Price Prediction</strong></h2>



<p>On the IOTA price chart, its Relative Strength Index at the beginning of 2021 was 46.2. Meanwhile, its RSI kept increasing and became overbought towards the end of February. Currently, IOTA is technically indicating a buy position. However, its price is not growing by the day. Meanwhile, 2021 is still in its early days, and IOTA news might gain more attention in the market later.</p>



<p>As 2021 goes by, the IOTA price might improve due to its real-world use-case. Also, the IOTA Foundation has excellent partnerships and is working on more. If all these factors add up, MIOTA will be a coin of tremendous value. Thus, if you find the MIOTA token worth buying, you can manage it using the Atomic Wallet app.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-buy-iota"><strong>How to Buy IOTA</strong></h2>



<p>Atomic provides a cryptocurrency wallet with unique features. The Atomic Wallet supports over 500 cryptocurrencies and keeps your funds safe. You can always use Atomic to hold IOTA in 2021 or for the long-term. Meanwhile, you cannot buy MIOTA tokens on the Atomic wallet for now.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-exchange-iota"><strong>How to Exchange IOTA</strong></h2>



<p>Users of Atomic Wallet app can also exchange cryptocurrencies directly. You can swap many pairs at their current market rates now on your wallet. Log in to your wallet, tap on &#8216;Exchange,&#8217; and you are good to go. Ensure you download the Atomic Wallet mobile app and create a free cryptocurrency wallet.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TRON-PRICE-PREDICTION-2098-1-1918x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34348" ></figure>



<h3 id="what-is-tron-trx"><strong>What is Tron (TRX)</strong></h3>



<p>Tron is a cryptocurrency project that emphasizes eliminating the middlemen. Tron wants to DECENTRALIZE THE WEB. Meanwhile, Tron&#8217;s focus is not just on decentralizing finance and money. It aims to decentralize content-sharing and entertainment. No doubt, few entertainment giants centralize and control content distribution on the internet. These companies rake in massive revenue from adverts and consumer subscriptions. At the same time, they serve the content creators peanuts out of the income. Hence, Tron wants to build an ecosystem whereby content creators will enjoy direct and full compensation for their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tron runs an open blockchain network that has a distributed storage facility. Thus, it is efficient in storing content, and transactions are fast. Tronix (TRX) is the token for the Tron network. TRX serves as a means by which consumers pay content producers and developers. Developers can as well create their coins. However, this has to run on the Tron blockchain. Payment for content goes directly to producers&#8217; wallets, and thereby they receive full compensation for their work.</p>



<p>Tron is a project of the Tron Foundation. Tron Foundation is a Singapore-based non-profit entity that operates the Tron network. Tron Foundation has the responsibility to ensure transparency, openness, and fairness in Tron&#8217;s development. Justin Sun is the founder of the Tron Foundation and the brain behind Tron.

<h3 id="market-prediction-for-tron-trx-price-2021"><strong>Market prediction for Tron (TRX) price 2021</strong></h3>



<p>Tron&#8217;s current price has been very reluctant to go close to $0.1. Since it had a $0.3 all-time high in 2018, there has been no major Tron news. TRX price continues to consolidate around $0.01 and $0.06 since January 2020 to date. Why is there no better Tron news? Some experts blame Tron&#8217;s supply. Of course, a ton of over 100 billion tokens could keep a coin at the ground level. However, other cryptocurrency enthusiasts blame Justin Sun, the CEO of Tron. Sun is known for pushing announcements that end up not happening. Disappointments can scare off investors, and it has scared many away from buying Tron.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, during this write-up, the Tron coin price is $0.0460. It has a live market capitalization of over $3,298,073,000, and it ranks 25 among other crypto assets. Currently, the amount of Tron circulating is 71,659,657,370 TRX. However, some reports say it is 71,659,659,265 TRX that is in circulation. Meanwhile, Tron&#8217;s total token is over 100.8 billion TRX tokens. Yet, there is no information about its maximum supply. TRX currently trades on about two-hundred crypto-trading exchanges.</p>



<h2 id="tron-predictions-for-2021"><strong>Tron Predictions for 2021</strong></h2>



<p>There are various opinions and Tron predictions. Some cryptocurrency investors and analysts gave ideas on how far TRX prices could go in 2021.</p>

<p>Also, Wallet investor&#8217;s investment indicator shows that investors are currently bullish on Tron.</p>



<h2 id="tron-price-prediction-2021"><strong>Tron Price Prediction 2021</strong></h2>



<p>Tron is an open blockchain network that facilitates decentralized content distribution. At launch, Tron operated on the ERC-20 network. However, to fulfill its goals, Tron created its blockchain, which is the TRC-10. The Tron network has a high transaction speed, and payment fees are relatively low. Tron&#8217;s use-case also extends to the hosting of decentralized applications and smart contracts. Developers or content creators who work on the Tron network use TRX as a means of payment. Currently, there are over 23 million Tron accounts, according to stats on the Tron website. Also, over 1.6 billion transactions have been processed on the Tron network so far.</p>



<p>Moreover, there are over 1,600 decentralized applications (Dapps) on the Tron public chain. These Dapps boast of about $24.75 million in transaction volume. The growing adoption of the Tron network could be the solution to Tron&#8217;s low price.</p>



<p>TRX has existed since 2017, and it is still struggling to hit $0.1. A stagnant price is not a good sign for buyers in comparison to other crypto assets. Meanwhile, Tron CEO Justin Sun is quite influential and popular. Recently, he made it to the &#8220;Asia 30 under 30&#8221; Forbes list. However, there was no improvement in the Tron coin price. Even within the crypto community, Sun does not have much recognition. These setbacks could be the reason why the Tron price USD remains relatively low.</p>



<h2 id="tron-price-prediction-2025"><strong>Tron Price Prediction 2025</strong></h2>



<p>Majorly, long-term cryptocurrency bag holders reap high returns on investments. However, things might take the other way sometimes, and some coins may fail to pump in the long-run. Many cryptocurrency price analysis websites have bullish Tron news for 2025. CryptoGround predicted that Tron would sell at $0.1 in the next five years. Likewise, Digital-Coin-Price forecast that by 2025, Tron price USD will be above $0.13. Furthermore, Longforecast predicted that in five years, the Tron value would be $0.17.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, PRIME XBT gave their Tron price prediction based on a significant Tron current price chart analysis. An inverse head and shoulder forming on high timeframes suggest that TRX price might not spike very high as some think. However, Tron will be a profitable investment in the long term.</p>



<h2 id="tron-predictions-verdict"><strong>Tron Predictions Verdict</strong></h2>



<p>Tron is a 10-year long project. It started with the Exodus stage in 2017 and will complete at the Eternity phase by 2027. Currently, Tron is in the Great Voyage stage, and this will last till July 2021. Each step brings a new development into the Tron network and focuses on Tron&#8217;s goal – Decentralize the Web. In the end, the Tron network will provide a decentralized platform for content creators to promote their work. Completing these development stages will improve Tron news could be an add-on to drive Tron value higher.</p>



<p>To decentralize the web, Tron has to work with real firms that believe in blockchain. First, Tron Foundation acquired BitTorrent and integrated its 100 million users into the Tron network. Furthermore, Tron became partners with various companies across Asia. One of the many partners of Tron is oBike. oBike developed a utility token on the Tron blockchain, which customers can use to pay the company. Likewise, Bitmain, Zag – S&amp;W, and Global Social Chain are partners of Tron. Partnerships can spread Tron news as it drives adoption. An increase in the use of TRX will be very encouraging to investors and will enhance Tron&#8217;s value. TRX will be a profitable coin in 2021 and an excellent asset to HODL.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Atomic Wallet app provides a unique and secure wallet to store Tron.</p>

<p>Before the emergence of the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-ethereum-blockchain" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-blockchain" rel="noreferrer noopener">blockchain</a>,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-cryptocurrency" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryptocurrency</a>&nbsp;trading was done on centralized exchanges like Kraken, Bitfinex, Poloniex, and Gemini, where limit orders and order book-based trading was implemented, with high trade volumes and increasing liquidity. Order book-based trading is a form of trading where buy and sell orders are placed in a list alongside the total amount in each order, showing market depth. Market depth is the amount of buy and sell orders for a digital asset placed in the order book. Trades were executed by placing a buy or sell order matched with a sell or buy order on the opposite side of the order book of any digital asset.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="what-is-uniswap"><strong>WHAT IS UNISWAP?</strong></h3>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://uniswap.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uniswap</a>&nbsp;is an open-source,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-decentralization" rel="noreferrer noopener">decentralized</a>&nbsp;exchange built on the Ethereum blockchain. Uniswap is an automated liquidity protocol where there is no order book or any centralized party required to make trades, allowing users to trade without intermediaries and with a high degree of decentralization and censorship-resistance. Created by Hayden Adams on November 2nd, 2018, to implement a protocol first described by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Uniswap has replaced the traditional architecture of digital asset exchanges with a design called Constant Product Market Maker, a variant of an Automated Market Maker (AMM). Hayden&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://t.co/czTqyRit7u" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>&nbsp;the Uniswap news,</p>



<p><em>&nbsp;&#8220;Excited to announce the launch of @UniswapExchange! It&#8217;s a protocol for automated exchange of ERC20 tokens on Ethereum.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Automated market makers are&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/smart-contracts" rel="noreferrer noopener">smart contracts</a>&nbsp;that hold liquidity reserves (or liquidity pools, as the name implies) which traders can trade against. Liquidity providers fund these reserves or pools. Uniswap allows its users to have full control of their funds at all times as opposed to a centralized exchange by giving users control of their&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-are-private-keys-and-how-they-work" rel="noreferrer noopener">private keys</a>, also giving room for quick trades. According to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://defipulse.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Defipulse</a>, Uniswap is currently the fifth-largest decentralized finance (DeFi) platform with over $3.7 Billion worth of crypto assets locked away on its protocol. The fast growth and expansion of the DeFi market have catalyzed Uniswap&#8217;s exponential growth, surpassing Coinbase&#8217;s daily trading volume on August 30th, 2020. Hayden Adams, the founder of Uniswap, tweeted this Uniswap news,</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Wow, Uniswap 24hr trading volume is higher than Coinbase for the first time. Uniswap: $426M Bank Coinbase: $348M. Hard to express with how crazy this is.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>On September 16th, 2020, Uniswap news of UNI&#8217;s airdrop (Uniswap&#8217;s governance tokens then worth about $1,200) to all its users who interacted with the Decentralized exchange by either swapping tokens or providing liquidity was released. UNI allows its holders to participate in governance decisions like future upgrades via voting. UNI was distributed to about 50,000 active Ethereum addresses, making this airdrop one of the most widely distributed tokens in the cryptocurrency space. September was a month to remember Uniswap users as Uniswap&#8217;s monthly volume of $15.4 Billion surpassed Coinbase&#8217;s monthly volume of $13.6 Billion.

<p>Upon releasing this Uniswap news, Ethhub founder, Anthony Sassano, explained how this growth in Uniswap volume proves that Ethereum is continuously impacting crypto and blockchain. Sassano said,</p>



<p><em>&#8220;They told you that decentralized exchanges on Ethereum were a fad &#8211; they were [so] incredibly wrong. DEXs did $23.5 billion worth of volume in September alone! Betting against Ethereum has and always will be a bad move.&#8221;</em></p>



<h3 id="price-history-of-uniswap"><strong>PRICE HISTORY OF UNISWAP</strong></h3>



<p>First priced at about $3.6 per UNI, Uniswap value has been on the rise since its initial airdrop, with the initial airdrop worth about $1,200, now worth over $8,300 a Uniswap price of $20.8, an increase of about 500%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As many centralized and decentralized exchanges rushed to list UNI, Uniswap price quickly began a downtrend in September with airdrop sellers controlling the market, with UNI price hitting an&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/all-time-low" rel="noreferrer noopener">All-Time Low</a>&nbsp;of $1.79 November 5th, 2020. Within this period, DeFi lost some of its momenta as most DeFi coins and tokens hit new lows while the yield farming craze calmed down.</p>

<p>Crypto News, a pioneer news media network covering events and happenings in the crypto space and the growing blockchain industry, has made its Uniswap price prediction for 2021 with a minimum target of $80 Uniswap price as more adoption of DeFi and blockchain technology takes place. This Uniswap prediction would give an ROI of over 200% from Uniswap&#8217;s current price.</p>



<h3 id="reasons-for-different-uniswap-price-predictions"><strong>REASONS FOR DIFFERENT UNISWAP PRICE PREDICTIONS</strong></h3>



<p>Several reasons have resulted in the different Uniswap price predictions.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Global recognition and adoption of DeFi:</strong>&nbsp;The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, on February 8th, 2021, released a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/stlouisfed/status/1358883628600721411?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener">result</a>&nbsp;of its research into DeFi and how it may lead to a new paradigm shift in the financial industry, once again signaling the presence of institutions in the DeFi space. People demand the freedom of money with trust for the traditional financial system collapsing, the need for a decentralized, trustless, immutable and secure system to depend on grows. The cryptocurrency and blockchain industry could thus see increased volatility(impacting Uniswap&#8217;s value) in the coming year as more adoption by financial institutions and corporations occurs.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>COVID-19 pandemic:</strong>&nbsp;The breakout of Coronavirus in 2020 led to many countries and businesses&#8217; shutdown, with a negative ripple effect on businesses and general living. With the end of the pandemic in sight, many corporations and individuals are looking for &#8220;profit yielding opportunities&#8221; such as digital assets trading, which operates 24/7 instead of the traditional markets. This remains one reason for the current parabolic move in the cryptocurrency market, which looks likely to continue.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Unstable global economy: Andreas Steno, Chief global FX/FI strategist of Nordea, stated that more than $3 trillion was printed in 2020 alone, meaning that about 20% of all existing supply United States Dollar was created in 2020. Incumbent President of the United States, Joe Biden, recently stated his intention to release more stimulus packages before the end of Q1, meaning more dollars would be printed into circulation, reducing its value. This has encouraged investors, financial institutions, and corporate organizations to seek better value in precious metals, commodities, stocks, and other nascent technologies like Bitcoin and digital assets. Further instability in the global economy with events like printing fiat by governments could result in a &#8216;new age&#8217; parabolic advance in the cryptocurrency/ digital assets market.</li></ul>



<h3 id="uniswap-price-prediction-for-2025"><strong>UNISWAP PRICE PREDICTION FOR 2025</strong></h3>



<p>Fundamental analysis of Uniswap&#8217;s price suggests a bullish momentum in the coming years as the adoption of decentralized finance continues, with Uniswap&#8217;s value growing massively in both price, volume, user base, and liquidity(from $24Million on June 1st, 2020 to $4.3Billion on February 11th, 2021).</p>



<p>Technical analysis of Uniswap&#8217;s price suggests a very bullish momentum for Uniswap&#8217;s governance token, UNI. As predicted by many analysts, a peak Uniswap USD price of $100 in 2025 is expected as Uniswap goes into price discovery, surpassing its high of $22.7. A retracement to the buy zones for Uniswap price as shown in the chart below should be expected before a new parabolic move, but in all, the momentum for Uniswap price remains bullish for the coming years.</p>

<h3 id="prediction-verdict"><strong>PREDICTION VERDICT</strong></h3>



<p>Like many investors, institutions, and fintech companies adopt DeFi and blockchain, a parabolic rise in digital assets&#8217; price is expected. In the short term, the Uniswap USD price could witness a few weeks to months of retracement and range from this parabolic move before finding strong support. Traders who can take leveraged longs and/or shorts on Uniswap trading pairs would make profits off a Uniswap price retracement, while long-term investors who have long-term targets hold Uniswap in their wallets. In the short term, Uniswap news of Uniswap listing on new exchanges, adoption, and new developments could send Uniswap price roaring again as the cryptocurrency market remains the most volatile market in the world.</p>



<p>Uniswap can be a profitable investment option for investors looking to invest in cryptocurrencies/ digital assets or traders monitoring UNI price action. At the current Uniswap USD price of $20.8, a $1,000 fiat purchase is equivalent to 48.1UNI, and based on the above prediction, a long-term increase is expected to happen, with a target price of $100. So within five years, a $1,000 investment would be worth over $4,000 with about 400%. Uniswap can be purchased and managed using Atomic wallet.</p>
