<p>While the concept of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can be traced back to 2012, it&#8217;s only recently that they&#8217;ve garnered sustained attention from the mainstream media.</p>



<p>This has occurred as they&#8217;ve skyrocketed in popularity of late, with several high-profile sales having taken place through February and March this year. An original Banksy was recently burnt and destroyed as part of a viral live-streamed video before being&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56335948" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold via an NFT that represented the work for $380,000</a>.</p>



<p>In February, a classic LeBron James clip was sold in NFT form for $99,000, while a looping video clip iteration also changed hands for $26,128 around the same time.</p>



<p>This represents just the tip of the iceberg for NFTs, which have evolved considerably since their inception nine years ago.&nbsp;<strong><em>But what exactly is an NFT, and what are its most prominent use cases?</em></strong></p>



<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-non-fungible-tokens">A Brief History of Non-Fungible Tokens</h2>



<p>At its core, an NFT is simply a unique and non-interchangeable digital asset whose ownership is recorded on a blockchain. The word &#8216;fungible&#8217; means interchangeable, so assets categorized as NFTs simply cannot be exchanged as like-for-like entities on any particular network.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that virtually any piece of digital content can be minted into an NFT, from iconic Banksy artwork to songs and famous tweets. The scope and potential use cases for NFTs remain virtually endless. To this end, Twitter founder Jack Dorset recently put his first-ever tweet (from March 21st, 2006) up for auction in the form of an NFT. Bidding has already&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/jack-dorsey-posted-the-first-tweet-15-years-ago-now-its-selling-as-an-nft-3560699.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached $2.5 million at the time of writing</a>.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll further detail how NFTs work later in the piece, but arguably the first iteration of this technology existed in the form of colored coins. Colored coins were first discussed in a 2012 blog post written by Yoni Assia, with these entities consisting of small denominations of a single Bitcoin (BTC) token. Colored coins subsequently represented several assets across various use cases, including property, coupons, and company shares. Despite their complex nature, they represented a huge evolution in Bitcoin&#8217;s capabilities, while they also laid the foundation for the modern NFTs that we see replicated today. This partly inspired the launch of Counterparty in 2014, which was formed as a peer-to-peer financial platform and distributed an open-source protocol developed on top of the original Bitcoin blockchain. This allowed for asset creation within a decentralized exchange, while it also housed the first-ever game (Spells of Genesis) to issue in-game assets onto a blockchain in April 2015.</p>



<p>Similar projects followed as the concept of NFTs grew in popularity, although it wasn&#8217;t until October 2017 that it began to hit the mainstream. At this time, &#8216;CryptoKitties&#8217; was launched on Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain network, with this described as a blockchain-based virtual game that enabled players to adopt, raise, and trade virtual cats in the form of NFTs.</p>



<p>Coinciding with Bitcoin and the crypto market&#8217;s infamous bull run of 2017, the launch of this unique project hit the headlines, even featuring on mainstream news sites such as CNN. This was largely due to the relatively high profits available through trading. Simultaneously, the immense success and popularity of the game caused many to realize the full potential of leveraging NFTs.</p>



<p>Before this years&#8217; explosion of non-fungible token sales, 2018 and 2019 also saw considerable exponential growth within the NFT ecosystem. During this time, more than 100 high-profile projects were initiated. However, it&#8217;s fair to say that the trade volumes for NFTs and similar assets remained small about alternative cryptomarket niches.</p>



<p>Still, the market for selling NFTs as a digital representation of iconic artwork has exploded of late, with YouTube personality Logan Paul making more than $5 million selling such assets over two days as recently as February 2021.</p>



<p>Overall, it&#8217;s thought that musicians have now sold more than $4 million in NFTs throughout the global industry, with this number likely to increase exponentially in the near, medium, and long-term. We&#8217;ll explain why this may be the case a little later on.</p>



<h2 id="how-do-non-fungible-tokens-work">How Do Non-Fungible Tokens Work?</h2>



<p>As we&#8217;ve already touched on, digital content and records can be &#8216;minted&#8217; into NFTs, with this referring to the process of creating a unique file that exists on a particular blockchain.</p>



<p>In this process, the blockchain acts as a decentralized ledger that records and tracks each NFT while simultaneously displaying the associated transaction history. This data is subsequently coded to have a unique ID and other forms of metadata that no other NFT can replicate, creating a unique and immutable digital record that third parties cannot manipulate.</p>



<p>The software programs used to code non-fungible tokens are referred to as smart contracts, which are central to contemporary blockchains&#8217; appeal and can govern fundamental aspects such as the transfer and ownership of established NFTs. Like the vast majority of software and blockchain applications, NFTs can also be programmed far beyond ownership and transferability concepts. This allows individuals to access far greater functionality, including the capacity to link a particular NFT to an alternative type of digital asset.</p>



<p>Thanks to this transparent, immutable, and ultimately scalable process, NFTs are afforded scarce and originality attributes. This makes them particularly attractive when paired with digital media, while it also allows unique assets (such as Banksy artwork) to be replicated by NFTs without losing their inherent value. In this instance, a human asset is simply transferred into a digital one, with the value subsequently moved seamlessly onto the remaining NFT.</p>



<h2 id="why-non-fungible-tokens-are-all-the-hype-today">Why Non-Fungible Tokens are all the hype today</h2>



<p>Given that the history of NFTs can be traced back to 2012, the question that remains is why non-fungible tokens are all the hype today?</p>



<p>The first observation is that the diverse realms of gaming, art, and music have become increasingly digitized in recent times, both in terms of development and distribution. As a result, they&#8217;re increasingly compatible with the technology underpinning NFTs, creating an easy-to-understand and more appealing proposition for investors and artists.</p>



<p>From the sole perspective of artists, of course, the proliferation of NFTs provides a unique opportunity for them to sell their content in a completely novel and unique way. As a result, they can arguably sell even mediocre content at a price premium while simultaneously accessing free and often viral marketing through social media and traditional news networks.</p>



<p>Remember, NFTs also boast a tangible sense of scarcity and a traceable real-world link, which automatically increases the asset&#8217;s value while creating a new and exciting outlet for speculative money. Similarly, NFTs allow for quick and secure transactions that leverage the unique advantages of blockchain technology, with this particularly appealing for those whose motivation is grounded in getting rich quickly without compromising on the viability of individual transactions.</p>



<p>Of course, the newest surge of NFT sales is seeing people pay tens of thousands for assets that would otherwise arguably be freely available on social media. Such assets can include memes and animated gifs, with one particular animated cat altered to include a dogecoin token recently selling online for $69,000.</p>



<p>In this case, the NFT assets don&#8217;t boast any inherent value or real scarcity, so their popularity is a little harder to explain. This is until you begin to understand how hype itself continues to drive the market for NFTs, with this generating a significant buzz that draws attention to the wider crypto marketplace and the unique technology that underpins it.</p>



<h2 id="non-fungible-token-use-cases">Non-Fungible Token Use Cases</h2>



<p>As we&#8217;ve already seen, art and musical content have dominated the NFT niche, with aspects such as creation, copyright, and ownership highly important and lucrative within these spaces.</p>



<p>However, there are other prominent (albeit less obvious) use cases for non-fungible tokens, including the following:</p>



<h3 id="the-gaming-industry">The Gaming Industry</h3>



<p>As digital games such as CryptoKitties highlight, there has always been an affinity between gaming and NFT technology.</p>



<p>Certainly, the gaming industry has spent much of the last decade creating virtual economies within an individual game&#8217;s ecosystem. This is underpinned by the type of freemium model that characterizes World of Warcraft (WoW) Fortnite.</p>



<p>In the case of blockchain-based titles, NFTs enable players to trade in-game collectibles securely and in real-time while also guaranteeing authenticity and allowing for fully verified transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, gaming-related NFTs work similarly to some cryptocurrency networks, particularly as users can participate in their governance and offer input into discussions on future development within a particular game&#8217;s ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="sports">Sports</h3>



<p>There are various transaction challenges faced by fans across a diverse array of sports, from the sale of historic memorabilia without provenance to counterfeit merchandise and tickets&#8217; widespread deployment.</p>



<p>Make no mistake; using NFTs and blockchain technology can help eliminate these issues, as their immutable and transparent nature prevents counterfeit collectibles or tickets from being sold.</p>



<p>One iteration of this would see unique and tokenized game tickets issued directly on the blockchain network, providing a practical use case for NFTs while enabling buyers to protect themselves at all times. While each game ticket may be similar, every entity will be defined by unique identifiable information that connects it to the designated owner on the blockchain.</p>



<p>Going forward, it&#8217;s thought that sporting merchandise could ultimately be represented by NFTs, allowing the owner to register and verify official items as theirs.</p>



<h3 id="real-estate">Real Estate</h3>



<p>Real estate represents a slightly different use case for non-fungible tokens, while it is also one of the most interesting types of projects in the marketplace. In this example, a single property is fractionated into multiple assets, subsequently purchased by investors on a blockchain-based exchange network. This allows for collaborative ownership of individual properties, while it also provides a seamless and simplified transaction process whether you&#8217;re buying or selling a house. Most importantly, this eliminates the need for a third-party intermediary, potentially lowering the cost of buying and selling homes in the process.</p>



<p>By deploying NFTs as a form of smart contract, sellers can also minimize the risk of conflict or legal disputes about land ownership or a particular estate.</p>



<h3 id="erc-721-vs-erc-1155-vs-non-fungible-tokens-comparison">ERC-721 vs. ERC-1155 vs. Non-Fungible Tokens Comparison</h3>



<p>When titles such as Cryptokitties were first created on the Ethereum blockchain, developers sought out ways to enhance the standard of gaming through this medium. To this end, non-fungible tokens were developed using the ERC721 standard, which created a formal template that other participating developers agreed to follow from the outset.</p>



<p>However, we live in the age of third-generation blockchains, some of which offer similar functionality to Ethereum and have evolved the concept of decentralized gaming. As a result of this, Enjin has created a newer and approved Ethereum token standard, with this referred to as ERC1155.</p>



<h4 id="but-what-are-the-differences-between-these-standards-nbsp">But what are the differences between these standards?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Well, ERC-721 is limited to non-fungible tokens only, whereas the ERC1155 standard also makes allowances for fungible and interchangeable assets such as crypto tokens.</p>



<p>Currently, the ERC-721 standard only supports the transfer of a single token or asset at a time, while ERC1155 allows for much larger batch transfers that include numerous token IDs as part of a single transaction. Given that each Ethereum transaction takes between 15 and 30 seconds to complete attempting to transfer numerous ERC-721 tokens at once can be incredibly time-consuming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to smart contracts, ERC-721 assets require a separate and unique contract for every token iteration. However, ERC-1155 tokens can be deployed in a single, smart contract for infinite token and asset types, affording users far greater flexibility and autonomy when creating agreements between parties.</p>



<h3 id="the-10-most-famous-non-fungible-tokens-so-far">The 10 Most Famous Non-Fungible Tokens (So Far!)</h3>



<p>We&#8217;ll close with a list of the ten most famous and lucrative NFT transactions of all-time, highlighting the immense appeal and popularity of this asset class and how it exploded of late.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="these-include">These include:</h4>



<p><strong>10. Nyan Cat by Chris, on Foundation ($590,000):&nbsp;</strong>This featured the popular piece of Internet folklore called the Nyan cat meme, which sold for $590,000 (or 300 ETH) in February 2021.</p>



<p><strong>9. The Complete MF Collection by Beeple, on Nifty Gateway ($777,777.77):&nbsp;</strong>This unique NFT transaction combined blockchain-based art with an original, physical component and sold for a premium earlier this year.</p>



<p><strong>8. Hairy by Steve Aoki, on Nifty Gateway ($888,888.88):&nbsp;</strong>Similarly, musician Steve Aoki collaborated with Antoni Tudisco to produce a combination of the former&#8217;s music and a blue-and-purple figure while sold for a huge and rather specific sum of money.</p>



<p><strong>7. Not Forgotten, But Gone by WhlsBe, on Nifty Giveaway ($1 million):&nbsp;</strong>This 16-second video clip of a spinning, gold skeleton gummy bear was another sell recently on the Nifty Gateway platform and managed to reach the $1 million mark.</p>



<p><strong>6. Auction Winner Picks Name by SSX3LAU, on Nifty Gateway ($1.33 million):&nbsp;</strong>This example saw electronic music artist 3LAU join the NFT party. This major sale allowed the winner of an auction to name the song played in his next music video.</p>



<p><strong>5. CryptoPunk #6985, on Larva Labs ($1.54 million):&nbsp;</strong>This is the first CryptoPunk entry on our list, with this funky fedora one of the latest NFT sales to breach the coveted $1 million thresholds.</p>



<p><strong>4. First Tweet by Jack Dorsey on Valuables ($2.5 million or more):&nbsp;</strong>The auction above of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey&#8217;s first tweet closed on March 21st, with the final sale value sure to be $2.5 million or more when it&#8217;s finally confirmed.</p>



<p><strong>3. Crossroad by Beeple, on Nifty Gateway ($6.66 million):&nbsp;</strong>This is the second digital collection listed by Beeple, with this netting an incredible $6.66 million on the secondary sale market on February 24th.</p>



<p><strong>2. CryptoPunks #7804 and #3100 on Larva Labs ($7.6 million each):&nbsp;</strong>These two tradable CryptoPunk collectibles were sold on March 11th for a combined value of 4.2k Ethereum tokens, creating the second most valuable NFT transaction of all time.</p>



<p><strong>1. &#8220;Everydays: The First 5,000 Days&#8221; by Beeple, at Christie&#8217;s ($69 million):&nbsp;</strong>Beeple also produced the highest-selling NFT to date, with the crypto artist raising a staggering $69 million for a piece auctioned at the iconic Christies. This was a compilation of Beeple&#8217;s first 5,000 pieces of work, and we&#8217;re not sure that the record will be topped any time soon!</p>

<p>This article focuses on a popular yet underrated project – touted by many individuals in the crypto space; known as Vechain with the ticker VET. Let’s review its technological advantages and disadvantages, history, and how to store and manage the VET coin.<br>So what is Vechain? In short, this particular&nbsp;<a href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-cryptocurrency" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryptocurrency</a>&nbsp;can be described as an advanced host of innovative technological solutions aimed at data management and the Internet of things (IoT). With that approach, its ecosystems and applications are capable of tackling fake or counterfeit products, bogus insurances, and data manipulation among other issues in the real world.</p>



<h2 id="brief-history-nbsp">Brief History&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Vechain has a rich legacy and is arguably one of the oldest projects that are still around today. First and foremost, it is fundamentally a very fascinating project created by the founder &#8211; Sunny Lu. In the early days, Lu, Jay Zhang, and Jianliang Gu who are at the core of the team worked on Vechain for two years before emerging it onto the crypto scene in 2015. Vechain’s ICO started at $0.0008 during 2015 and spiked to an all-time high of $1.75 in January 2018, about a month after the 2017 bull run. However, things have changed significantly due to changes in the tokenomics.</p>



<p>On that side of the spectrum, Sunny Lu and his team decided to slightly re-brand the token to VechainThor and changed its original ticker from VEN to VET. They also increased the token supply to about 87 billion tokens and allowed users to convert from VEN to VET. Over the years Vechain has been able to secure some of the biggest partnerships in the cryptocurrency industry; from the likes of BMW, Renault, Microsoft, and Global Assurance Provider DV-VGL just to name a few.</p>



<h3 id="important-facts-in-vechain-s-history">Important facts in Vechain’s History</h3>



<ul><li>The mainnet launched on June 30<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;, 2018</li><li>The team has never sold VET/VEN on the open markets&nbsp;</li><li>Vechain was originally an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum Network</li></ul>



<h3 id="vechain-technology-and-advantages-nbsp">Vechain Technology and Advantages&nbsp;</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1536"  height="975"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vechain_advantages_and_disadvantages-1536x975-1.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34277"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vechain_advantages_and_disadvantages-1536x975-1.jpg 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vechain_advantages_and_disadvantages-1536x975-1-807x512.jpg 807w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vechain_advantages_and_disadvantages-1536x975-1-300x190.jpg 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vechain_advantages_and_disadvantages-1536x975-1-768x488.jpg 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vechain_advantages_and_disadvantages-1536x975-1-380x241.jpg 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vechain_advantages_and_disadvantages-1536x975-1-800x508.jpg 800w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vechain_advantages_and_disadvantages-1536x975-1-1160x736.jpg 1160w"  sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" ></figure>



<p>From a technological standpoint, Vechain is highly innovative and essential based on its ‘real world’ use case model. Product verification and authenticity are certainly part of the future and that is one of the core features of Vechain’s technology. Moreover, Vechain is a block-chain that allows developers to build other applications on top of it known as&nbsp;<a href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-are-dapps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Decentralized Applications (Dapps)</a>.</p>



<h4 id="advantages">Advantages:</h4>



<ul><li>Its technology is very future proof – RFIDs, data manipulation, and counterfeit goods prevention will be part of the new world which could be huge for Vechain.</li><li>There is a real-world use case to ensure the longevity of the project</li><li>The project develops on time thus prioritizing quality above all other things.</li></ul>



<h4 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages:</h4>



<ul><li>Its use case is slowly gaining adoption &#8211; With great technology, comes some sort of draw-back until it is made in full flight. In the same breath, Vechain is at a disadvantage when it comes to widespread usability in the current era. It could be said that it is a little ahead of its time since RFID and product authentication on the block-chain is not that widespread as yet. This is true because there are thousands of fake products and goods circulating among us daily, which means that this technology is not been fully utilized as yet.</li><li>Even though nodes play a huge role in the network, this brings about the question of Vechain’s level of&nbsp;<a href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-decentralization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decentralization</a>. Primarily because the network is dependent on Proof of Authority Nodes for heavy workloads or processes.</li></ul>



<h3 id="perspectives-and-takeaways">Perspectives and Takeaways</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/d7f8ba90-d207-40b0-9d99-c9883be764a7"  alt=""  class="wp-image-32502" ></figure>



<p>Vechain is a project built on a strong foundation with the vision of creating a world where businesses and customers can have peace of mind knowing that they are delivering/acquiring authentic products, goods or services. Since Vechain’s team recently updated their road map, things are beginning to look very interesting with a bright future ahead.</p>



<p>Sunny Lu and the team are aiming to take this innovative technology way beyond the block-chain. As a result the road-map now reflects the Application and Services Layer and Infrastructure Layer on top of the Thor Block-chain and the IoT Layer at the very bottom. While this is the way forward, there is a lot more coming from this project based on recent tweets, new partnerships, and Ask Me Anything (AMA ) sessions. Vechain also has other projects built on its ecosystems such as Safe Haven (SHA) and Plair (PLA) which is a gaming token.</p>



<p>One of the many reasons why it is believed that Vechain will continue to be a success is the constant innovation and progress achieved by the hard-working and passionate team. There is no doubt that businesses will continue to utilize the technologies provided by Vechain, whether it be product life-cycle management, supply chain process control, data deposit, data certification, and process certification from their Blockchain-as-a-service (Baas) platform solution known as Toolchain.</p>

<p><em>How to store and manage VET (in Atomic wallet, you can manage, exchange, and stake VET anonymously and securely)</em></p>



<p>Currently, VET sits at $0.016 at the time of writing, and you might be wondering how is it possible to acquire some VET right? Well, that’s not difficult at all when using the Atomic wallet. You can easily store and manage your VET by either sending it directly to your wallet address or exchanging other tokens that you already hold for VET. This can be done within a few clicks right within the Atomic Wallet.<img  loading="lazy"  src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SYVNrmnJYIYsE7Sgp6mzN9njDFBMdJhnPiukAnWPOo5PVtBlRYEGtJzv7wonUU9rnon6taRLVMC7z0QHV4f4YUuT6Qn9kscIHF0YdFuoOpM4ZG7oGmXqAnYp8vvjuadVPKk-YVyNK3HSszjGbQ"  width="665"  height="440" ></p>



<p>Should you want to stake your VET, there’s no input needed on your end. As long as you hold VET you’ll automatically generate VTHO, which is the gas for the network.

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>



<p>Without any doubt whatsoever, Vechain has proven to be a top contender in the crypto space. While many might argue that it is one of the most hyped projects today based on partnerships; it can be said that the hype is well deserved! For instance, their recent partnership with the Chinese Government to use the ecosystem to help fight against the corona-virus is a big leap for the project.</p>



<p>Vechain also demonstrated a healthy growth cycle but is still considered a sleeping giant awaiting the perfect time to be fully awoken. A huge advantage of Vechain is the sleuth of high-quality partners and investors that are onboard this solid ship. Moreover, the ecosystem is a working product with real-world use cases! If you’re thinking about getting some VET, download Atomic Wallet now on your Android or iPhone. If you’re a PC, Mac, or Linux user there is a version available for your device as well!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Crypto.com (CRO) is both the name of the flagship token and the ecosystem that revolves around its homonym cryptocurrency, whose utility is expressed by several services tied to it, including a physical VISA card (that users can utilize to make purchases and receive up to 8% cashback rewards), investment, financial and trading services and also exclusive gift card purchases ranging from Amazon’s gift cards to IKEA’s and many other selected brands.</p>



<p>But let’s proceed in orderly fashion and add the necessary “historic” and context details first.</p>



<p>Crypto.com’s Logo — The Ethereum Lion</p>

<h3 id="brief-history"><strong>Brief History</strong></h3>



<p>Born in Hong Kong in 2016, Crypto.com is considered by many one of the main platforms to invest in&nbsp;<a href="https://atomicwallet.io/bitcoin-explained" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-ethereum-blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>&nbsp;or any of the other 50+ cryptocurrencies currently supported by the CRO ecosystem. The company was founded by Kris Marszalek and Bobby Bao — respectively the CEO and head of corporate development — both coming from the ranks of the now defunct company Ensogo, where they fulfilled the same actual roles. While the last Ensogo experience ended up abruptly and not without strains, both Marszalek and Bao boast a long curriculum with experiences and successes, not just from the business/commerce world (BeeCrazy, JD.com) but also from the banking/financial domain (Deloitte, Merrill Lynch, China Renaissance).</p>



<p>Additionally, among Crypto.com’s most notable, and experienced team members to name there is Rafael Melo as CFO (15 years in finance and risk compliance), Gary Or as CTO (engineer with 9+ years of experience in AI and Machine Learning), Eric Anziani (ex Goldman Sachs, McKinsey and Paypal) and Jason Lau as CISO (multi-award winning cybersecurity professional).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since its inception in 2016, the company has been growing steadily both in its ranks (now counting more that 290 employees) and in terms of partnerships (Kaiko, nopCommerce, BCVault, Cointracking, IDAXA to name a few), casting it in the Olympus of the most renowned projects in the crypto sphere to this day.</p>



<p>Kris Marszalek — Crypto.com’s CEO and Co-Founder</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="550"  height="525"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/output-onlinepngtools.png"  alt="Kris Marszalek — Crypto.com’s CEO and Co-Founder"  class="wp-image-34263"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/output-onlinepngtools.png 212w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/output-onlinepngtools.png 536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/output-onlinepngtools.png 550w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/output-onlinepngtools.png 1131w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/output-onlinepngtools.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/output-onlinepngtools.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/output-onlinepngtools.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/output-onlinepngtools.png 24w"  sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" ></figure>



<h3 id="crypto-com-value-proposition"><strong>Crypto.com Value Proposition</strong></h3>



<p>As hinted earlier above, the Crypto.com value proposition can be concisely condensed into 3 main core products :&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Trading</li><li>Payment Services</li><li>Financial Services</li></ul>



<p>Let’s delve deeper into each of these 3 directives.</p>



<h3 id="crypto-com-trading-services"><strong>Crypto.com Trading Services</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1024"  height="647"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_GBi_U-6XrlgGOmwJ89vNCQ.jpeg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34259"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_GBi_U-6XrlgGOmwJ89vNCQ.jpeg 1024w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_GBi_U-6XrlgGOmwJ89vNCQ-810x512.jpeg 810w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_GBi_U-6XrlgGOmwJ89vNCQ-300x190.jpeg 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_GBi_U-6XrlgGOmwJ89vNCQ-768x485.jpeg 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_GBi_U-6XrlgGOmwJ89vNCQ-380x240.jpeg 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_GBi_U-6XrlgGOmwJ89vNCQ-800x505.jpeg 800w"  sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" ></figure>



<p>The Crypto.com Exchange Main Page&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Trading services are offered mainly via the exchange. Now, while it is still possible to buy and sell cryptocurrencies via the Crypto.com integrated app, the latter currently lacks most of the basic and advanced trading features that the platform offers: limit orders and margin trading are not yet implemented in the app, which instead was initially designed to support the Card payment services, but also lending and borrowing. At the moment the Crypto.com team is working towards implementing derivatives going live and OTC trading, but an announcement on when these features will be going live has not yet been made public.</p>



<p>In order to be able to start trading on Crypto.com and interact with the exchange dashboard, users only need to sign up, fill the forms and pass simple KYC procedures. New users that sign up on Crypto.com via referral are eligible to receive a registration bonus (up to 50$), provided that the referred entrant fulfills the minimum staking requirement of 1000 CRO (or more) on the exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what does “staking on the exchange” mean when it comes to CRO?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1338"  height="626"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_8720o6i9IYMcDzE4t9xE3Q.png"  alt="CRO Staking Tiers — Rebates, Discounts and Bonuses"  class="wp-image-34260"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_8720o6i9IYMcDzE4t9xE3Q.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_8720o6i9IYMcDzE4t9xE3Q.png 1024w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_8720o6i9IYMcDzE4t9xE3Q.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_8720o6i9IYMcDzE4t9xE3Q.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_8720o6i9IYMcDzE4t9xE3Q.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_8720o6i9IYMcDzE4t9xE3Q.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_8720o6i9IYMcDzE4t9xE3Q.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_8720o6i9IYMcDzE4t9xE3Q.png 1338w"  sizes="(max-width: 1338px) 100vw, 1338px" ></figure>



<p>CRO Staking Tiers — Rebates, Discounts and Bonuses</p>



<p>Staking on the exchange gives concrete shape to CRO’s utility as a token, by granting users lower trading fees and rebates: users that stake at least 5000 CRO for 6 months on the exchange get access not only to discounted maker/taker trading fees (aka Crypto.com’s “Stake-to-Take Program”) but they can also earn 10% APY interest (paid daily) and have access to “The Syndicate” — a fund raising platform where, bi-weekly, some of the most famous crypto projects and their tokens are showcased, giving the chance to Crypto.com users to allocate their available CROs and receive a share of the showcased tokens at a 50% discount.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, in order to participate to Syndicate events and their allocation, users need to provide a minimum amount of CRO staked on their Crypto.com Exchange account and have traded the corresponding value in the past 30 days (see the sample chart below for reference).&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1314"  height="1054"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_mM4BWT34DV5lsBnW1pzLfQ.png"  alt="CRO Staking Maximum Allocation"  class="wp-image-34261"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_mM4BWT34DV5lsBnW1pzLfQ.png 252w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_mM4BWT34DV5lsBnW1pzLfQ.png 638w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_mM4BWT34DV5lsBnW1pzLfQ.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_mM4BWT34DV5lsBnW1pzLfQ.png 1346w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_mM4BWT34DV5lsBnW1pzLfQ.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_mM4BWT34DV5lsBnW1pzLfQ.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_mM4BWT34DV5lsBnW1pzLfQ.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_mM4BWT34DV5lsBnW1pzLfQ.png 1314w"  sizes="(max-width: 1314px) 100vw, 1314px" ></figure>



<p>* Please do note that the figures are subject to change dynamically with market conditions and CRO appreciation/depreciation</p>



<p>Each Syndicate staking tier has a maximum allocation cap, which can be increased only via the staking of more CROs on the Crypto.com’s exchange. By allocating more CRO tokens during the Syndicate events, users also increase the share of their commitment, which in turn boosts the amount of the featured token they will receive after the Syndicate will have completed. It’s important to note that CRO tokens allocated for the Syndicate — while awaiting for the final distribution — are locked for a week, so opportunity costs consideration come into play. Furthermore, the gains made by entering the syndicates are dependent on the number of participants, as well as the total amount of CROs allocated, which are therefore subject to variations each time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="768"  height="345"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_evRv3faRwNrdJaP1JTQZNA.png"  alt="Crypto.com"  class="wp-image-34262"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_evRv3faRwNrdJaP1JTQZNA.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_evRv3faRwNrdJaP1JTQZNA.png 1024w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_evRv3faRwNrdJaP1JTQZNA.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_evRv3faRwNrdJaP1JTQZNA.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_evRv3faRwNrdJaP1JTQZNA.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_evRv3faRwNrdJaP1JTQZNA.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_evRv3faRwNrdJaP1JTQZNA.png 380w"  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" ></figure>



<p>The Supercharger</p>



<p>Users that might be reluctant to stake tokens on the exchange – maybe due to the Syndicate’s stricter requirements to join in – can still turn their CRO holdings to the “Supercharger”. Quoted by Crypto.com as a “liquidity mining platform that allows users to deposit tokens in order to mine the most popular DeFi tokens”, the Supercharger is available both on the Crypto.com Exchange and App and has no entry prerequisites.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How does it work? Just like with the Syndicate, a featured token is “sponsored” by Crypto.com, this time for 30 days. During this period — aka the “Charging Period” — users can freely deposit/withdraw any amount of CRO tokens, as liquidity, into the Supercharger. Hourly snapshots of the CROs provided by each user are taken/captured and, at the end of the Charging Period, a proportional share of the user’s contribution is awarded to him/her. It’s worth highlighting two features about this tool:</p>



<p>I. Users are free to leave their assets deposited for some time (e.g. 7 days), then withdraw them, then re-deposit them, and so on, anytime. The final distribution will consider each depositing period as well as the amount of CRO provided by each user and withdrawing before the 30 days will still make the user eligible to get a part of the Supercharger rewards.</p>



<p>II. Just like the Supercharger requires 30 days “to charge”, the same concept is applied to the user’s rewards distribution: the interests earned will mature and be given out over the next 30 days after the charging period has ended (making the comprehensive charging period plus the post-charging a total of 60 days).</p>



<h3 id="crypto-com-s-payment-services"><strong>Crypto.com’s Payment Services</strong></h3>



<p>The Payment solutions provided by Crypto.com are declaredly meant to be the company’s leading service (as also stated in the whitepaper) and have definitely been driving user acquisition and adoption to the platform. Inside this category, it’s possible to enumerate two service lines: the Crypto.com Pay service and the MCO Visa Debit Card(now unofficially known by most as the CRO Visa Debit card, after the the discontinuation of the previous card-related MCO token).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1600"  height="890"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_Yri0Lu8ePeYfxydTJsGOEA.png"  alt="Crypto.com Pay with Gift Card"  class="wp-image-34264"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_Yri0Lu8ePeYfxydTJsGOEA.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_Yri0Lu8ePeYfxydTJsGOEA.png 920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_Yri0Lu8ePeYfxydTJsGOEA.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_Yri0Lu8ePeYfxydTJsGOEA.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_Yri0Lu8ePeYfxydTJsGOEA.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_Yri0Lu8ePeYfxydTJsGOEA.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_Yri0Lu8ePeYfxydTJsGOEA.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1_Yri0Lu8ePeYfxydTJsGOEA.png 1600w"  sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" ></figure>



<ul><li>The Crypto.com Pay service prizes users with cashback for utilizing the Pay feature inside the Crypto.com App to send or transfer CRO to other Crypto.com members or by selecting CRO as the payment method to purchase directly from several selected retail partners or indirectly by buying gift cards (and receiving up to 10% cashback on several brands).&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  alt="" ></figure>



<p>Crypto.com Pay</p>



<ul><li>The MCO Card — which can be ordered via the Crypto.com app — is a contactless wireless metal Visa Debit Card that offers several advantages to its owners. Again, users are required to undergo a successful KYC procedure and stake a specific amount of CROs to order the card, willingly locking them in for at least 6 months. It’s worth noting that the CRO tokens staked on the exchange (that provide rebates/discounted fees/syndicate benefits) do not cumulate with the CROs staked on the app for the card. Therefore users that already locked CRO tokens on the exchange will need to stake another amount of CRO to get their MCO card in the app, as the two are completely distinct, fulfill different roles and provide different benefits.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  alt="" ></figure>



<p>MCO Visa Cards — Staking Tiers, Rewards &amp; Benefits</p>



<p>Another aspects that deserves mention is the fact that Crypto.com has a referral program in place to bring new leads to the MCO Visa cards as well as to motivate current users to actively share these opportunities within their social circles. Referred users that order the MCO Card by using a valid referral code and then by staking the corresponding sum of CROs, will immediately receive $25. And, in equal measure, that same amount that goes to the referred person will be awarded to the referral as well.</p>



<p>The MCO Visa Card rewards &amp; benefits vary with the entity of the CRO staked on the app and cards are filled with perks ranging from cashbacks, full monthly reimbursement of Spotify, Netflix and Amazon subscriptions, rebates on Airbnb and Expedia purchases, free airport Lounge access, weekly awarded bonus interests calculated on the card-staked CROs and even a bombastic Private Jet Partnership for Obsidian Black MCO card owners — the high-end, top of the line among MCO cards.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  alt="" ></figure>



<p>The Complete Set of MCO Visa Debit Cards</p>



<p>So, we’ve seen that the CRO token powers both the Payment and the Visa card ecosystems and while I’ve already mentioned that CRO can be used as the source token to pay – using the Crypto.com Pay service – I must add that the cashback rewards are also paid in CRO instantly, after any eligible purchase.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="crypto-com-s-financial-services"><strong>Crypto.com’s Financial Services</strong></h3>



<p>The company’s financial products represent Crypto.com main source of revenue together with the exchange trading services and include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Crypto Earn — a service where users can deposit any among the 50+ tokens supported on the app and earn interest. The depositing options differ in time (from flexible/immediately liquid terms to a maximum of 3 months vesting time) and — clearly – the longer your staking period, the higher the APY that will be calculated on the deposited capital . Moreover, differently from what happens on the exchange, Crypto Earn interests are paid on a weekly basis.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  alt="" ></figure>



<p>Crypto Earn — CRO Staking Comparison</p>



<ul><li>Crypto Credit — this is Crypto.com’s financial solution to instantly lending/borrowing money with no deadlines attached and no credit check. It allows users to monetize some of their assets by holding them in escrow and receiving an equivalent sum in a stablecoin of choice among TUSD, PAX, USDC or USDT. At the moment of this writing, the currently depositable assets include CRO, BTC, XRP, ETH, LTC, EOS and XLM.&nbsp;</li><li>DeFi Swap represents Crypto.com’s take on Decentralized Swap Protocols. Via this application users can swap tokens (just like they would when using Uniswap or Balancer), provide liquidity to ERC-20 token pairs’ liquidity pools and earn interests for doing so (in the form of a percentage when any swapping occurs on that pair). Swapping and providing liquidity on DeFi Swap is no different than doing the same operation on Uniswap. The only main difference here, compared to other similar DeFi protocols, is tied to the possibility (again) of staking CRO tokens: by supplying a greater amount of CROs and for a longer period of time (up to a 4 years timeframe) liquidity providers can get a boost on the yield earned for providing the pool assets. Furthermore, new partner pools are periodically sponsored and supplying liquidity to these advertised selected pools is incentivized by Crypto.com in the form of token airdrops.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  alt="" ></figure>



<p>Crypto Earn &amp; Crypto Credit</p>



<h3 id="perspectives-and-takeaway"><strong>Perspectives and Takeaway</strong></h3>



<p>An overview of the CRO token and Crypto.com’s value offering would not be complete without contextualizing the pros and cons of the features, services and products that the platform is offering, especially in light of the most recent news revolving around the CRO ecosystem as a whole.</p>



<p>Despite the actual and sustained push of Bitcoin and Ethereum, in the past weeks, Crypto.com’s token (CRO) price fell gradually at first, then quite abruptly (after the 2nd week of October), from $0.15 per token to more than half of that value, establishing itself at around the $0.06 mark. The dip was probably aided by the announcement of the MCO-CRO swap (initially made public in August and officially completed on September 2nd) and the sharp cut of Exchange and Earn interest rates on Crypto.com’s exchange and app. More recently, the update to the current card staking rates occurred, establishing the actual increased amount of CRO tokens required to obtain higher tier cards.</p>



<p>Just as these news hit the headlines, many early Crypto.com and MCO adopters were reportedly dissatisfied by the company’s choices, which were addressed as the main factors leading to the substantial token “dip”. Nonetheless Crypto.com still managed to grow its user base achieving the impressive milestone of 5 million users, symbolizing that adoption is nevertheless much underway.</p>



<p>Adding to the above insight, the MCO Visa cards still represent the tip of the diamond in Crypto.com’s value proposition and maintain huge palatability, despite the growing competition in the cryptocurrency cards market (especially from major players such as Swipe, Binance Card, as well as new ones that are now staging their moves like for example Plutus, Eidoo or QuiverX). It can’t be underestimated the fact that the ample, diversified Card tiers haven’t stopped attracting a wide user audience, ranging from users who prefer a more humble 1% cashback, no-staking required, freely shipped Midnight Blue card, to more affluent, demanding customers that will appreciate a richly overcharged (with perks and an astounding 8% cashback) Obsidian Black VIP card.</p>



<p>Then Syndicate events, the Supercharger and DeFi Swap keep sustaining and adding more value to the CRO token, by providing users with a plethora of possibilities to earn and capitalize on their cryptocurrency investments. In all this, the CRO token plays the main role as the fundamental asset to even being able to access these tools and boosting payments, financial and trading related to the ecosystem, thus very pragmatically closing in towards true real world utility, aimed to both retail, institutional stakeholders and new future partners as well.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  alt="" ></figure>



<p>What’s coming next — Crypto.com Roadmap</p>



<p>Finally there’s a lot more coming down the road, with the next announced step being CRO Main Net Launch, planned for Q4 2020/Q1 2021, which will partially “detach” CRO dependency as an ERC-20 token from Ethereum. This will potentially imply lower gas fees (at least compared to the current ones) and streamlined transactions. The focus will then switch towards the shipment of MCO Debit Cards at a global level, direct partnership with key international players, DeFi Lending/Borrowing and DeFi Cards going live, as well as the aforementioned “exchange upgrades” with the coming of Derivatives and OTC. So many ambitious targets, which play along the team’s vision.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="what-is-dash"><strong>What is DASH?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/what-is-dash-coin-1920x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-32565" ></figure>



<p>Dash, a decentralized protocol, built on the bitcoin core code, has unique features that enable it to process anonymous transactions. Apart from privacy, its transactions are faster, with negligible fees. This is possible because of its key features which include masternodes, InstantSend and PrivateSend.</p>



<p>Interestingly, Dash is an open protocol, meaning that no single entity or individual controls it. Besides, it has its own blockchain, infrastructure and wallet.</p>



<h2 id="history"><strong>History</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/history-of-dash.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34094" ></figure>



<p>&nbsp;Dash is a bitcoin fork with an amusing history. In fact,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/eduffield44">Evan Duffield</a>, a software developer and an enthusiast of the bitcoin, developed the Dash coin. This is after he studied the bitcoin for a long time and observed its weaknesses which include lack of privacy, high transaction costs and scalability problem.</p>



<p>As a result, the Dash team launched the Coin on 18 January 2014. Originally, they used the name XCoin (XCO). However, in February 2014 they changed the name to Darkcoin before they rebranded it to Dash (Digital Cash) on 25 March 2015.</p>



<h2 id="the-dash-coin"><strong>The Dash coin</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/the-dash-coin.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34083" ></figure>



<p>Dash is a popular digital currency which is easy to use. Accordingly, the developer hoped that the Dash coin would achieve the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto, of being an alternative to fiat currency.</p>



<p>The major reason for this is its fungibility. This means that two dash coins can replace each other, the way a $1 note can replace another $1 note with no hassles. Thus, Dash is a safe and convenient payment method. Above this, it is portable and divisible, with low transaction cost. With these qualities, Dash is a basic alternative to fiat money as people can easily use it when carrying out their everyday transactions. It is usable both online and in shops.</p>



<p>Since its inception in 2014, Dash experiences price volatility like many cryptocurrencies. When the crypto market is bullish, the coin responds in a related manner. If the market turns bearish, its prices go into a downtrend. Surprisingly, from its launch in 2014 until the end of 2016, its price was less than $10.</p>



<p>After 2016, it entered a bullish trajectory. According to Primexbt, it peaked at $1 540 on 20 December 2017. In contrast, during the bearish market of 2018, its price fell to $40 before it picked up at the end of 2019.&nbsp; In 2020, at some point, its price rose to $120. At the time of writing this article, the price of Dash is US$103.70, as per CoinDesk rate.</p>



<h2 id="features"><strong>Features</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/features-of-dash.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34105" ></figure>



<p>Dash has unique features which differentiate it from bitcoin in particular and other cryptocurrencies in general. The main features are InstantSend, PrivateSend and Masternodes.</p>



<p><strong>Masternodes:</strong>&nbsp;The Dash network mining system operates at two levels, masternodes and miners. The masternodes act as special servers that perform the most important functions on the Dash network. In particular, the masternodes handle PrivateSend, InstantSend and governance and treasury functionalities.</p>



<p><strong>InstantSend</strong>: Using the masternodes technology, Dash offers instant and secure transactions. The protocol completes a transaction within two seconds. This is because masternodes validate transactions immediately.&nbsp; It is not possible for a user to make two different payments using the same funds because there is immediate transaction finality. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PrivateSend:</strong>&nbsp;Users carry out anonymous transactions on the Dash network. Notably, Dash improved the Coinjoin feature responsible for enabling breaking up of denominations. In the end, the masternodes mix up these denomination components, obscuring the origin of the funds. Therefore, all transactions are 100% private.</p>



<p><strong>Chainlocks:</strong>&nbsp;This feature enables the Dash Network to have certainty and finality of transactions. Because payments are immediate, transaction risks are very low.</p>



<p><strong>Self-governing and funding</strong>: This is another unique feature of Dash. In the Bitcoin network, miners get 100% of the reward. However, this is different with Dash network, where 10% of the rewards goes back to Dash. Thus, the platform uses these funds to institute further development and growth of the Dash coin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, the Dash network uses a democratic means of allocating its funds. Community members vote on all developmental projects and allocation of funds. This is in line with the decentralization trend that exists in the crypto world.</p>



<h2 id="token-information"><strong>Token Information</strong></h2>



<p>By design, the total Dash coin supply is 18 million.</p>



<p>According to Primexbt, its current market cap is $655 million.</p>



<h2 id="nbsp-advantages-of-dash"><strong>&nbsp;Advantages of Dash</strong></h2>



<p>The discussion has already touched on some advantages of the Dash coin. These include:</p>



<ul><li>The user is in total control of his/her Dash coin and can transact with anyone around the world at any time.</li><li>All transactions are anonymous and instant, with no possibility of double spend.</li><li>Also, the transactions are irreversible, avoiding any potential fraudulent activities.</li><li>Above all, the Dash network offers security and speed transactions.</li></ul>



<h2 id="disadvantages"><strong>Disadvantages</strong></h2>



<p>The major disadvantages of Dash Coin include:</p>



<ul><li>The Dash coin is not yet universally acceptable. Some people and entities do not accept it as medium of exchange.</li><li>The coin is vulnerable to currency volatility, like most cryptocurrencies.</li><li>The focus is limited in nature, that of being a medium of exchange.</li></ul>



<h2 id="dash-community"><strong>Dash community</strong></h2>



<p>Because of the popularity of the Dash coin, Dash has got a large community. In order to cater for their informational needs, it has several social platforms, including:https://reddit.com/r/dashpay/</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-is-monero-1920x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33885" ></figure>



<p>You have probably heard about the Monero coin and its contributions to the cryptocurrency industry and the global financial system at large. But if you haven&#8217;t, and have been looking for a privacy coin, which will allow you to carry out digital transactions with full anonymity, look no further because Monero is the answer.</p>



<p>Throughout this complete guide to Monero, we will be walking you through every aspect of Monero, including its features, advantages, history, and even how to make anonymous transactions with it.</p>



<p>Before we do that, let&#8217;s begin with&#8230;</p>



<p><strong>WHAT IS MONERO?</strong></p>



<p>Monero (XMR) is simply an efficient cryptocurrency developed on the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-blockchain" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blockchain</a>&nbsp;technology, to be open-source, allowing anyone to use it, created to achieve privacy while performing digital assets transactions.</p>



<p>This unique digital currency guarantees the privacy, anonymity, and security of cryptocurrency transactions with ease.</p>



<p>Monero is a leading privacy-centric cryptocurrency</p>



<p>based on the Cryptonote protocol. As of November 2017, it is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies at a market capitalization of USD 1.5B. While Bitcoin, the first and currently largest cryptocurrency, explicitly identifies which coin in the transaction graph is being spent, Cryptonote allows users to obscure the transaction graph by including chaff transaction inputs called</p>



<p>&#8220;mixins.&#8221; As a result, Monero has attracted users&#8217; attention requiring privacy that is superior to those Bitcoin provides.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>BRIEF HISTORY OF MONERO</strong></p>



<p>Monero is a cryptocurrency that originated from a cryptocurrency called Bytecoin, which was first released in 2012, using the CryptoNote technology as its underlying technology.</p>



<p>With the help of this technology, the full privacy of transactions carried out with the Bytecoin and any other CryptoNote based coin is guaranteed since it combines different keys while processing a transaction so that it will be impossible to track the origin of a transaction.</p>



<p>Due to some challenges with the supply of the Bytecoin, a team of 7 developers consisting of Riccardo Spagni and David Latapie and five others, who are well experienced in the digital assets industry, resolved to the creation of an even better digital currency. Bitmonero, popularly called Monero, a word that means coin in Esperanto, was created by forking the Bytecoin Blockchain.</p>



<p><strong>XMR TECHNOLOGY AND ADVANTAGES</strong></p>



<p>Monero has great features embedded in it, which makes it superior to many similar cryptocurrencies out there.</p>



<p>The idea behind Monero is simple: You and I should be able to give money to causes we believe in without anyone else knowing what causes we choose to support. We should be able to buy and sell things online without anyone else in the world knowing what we bought, who we bought it from, or that we even spent our money on.</p>



<p>In other words, we should have complete online payment privacy. And Monero aims to provide it.</p>



<p>Monero has five key features that make it the most secure and private cryptocurrency currently available, And they are as follow;</p>



<p><strong>Stealth Address</strong>: The stealth address feature is a massive upgrade over bitcoin&#8217;s privacy. Here&#8217;s the best way to think of it. With bitcoin, you reveal your real &#8220;home address&#8221; to send and receive bitcoin. With Monero, you use the equivalent of a &#8220;post office box&#8221; as your address to send and receive Monero. By using a virtual P.O. box instead of your actual address, your transactions cannot be linked back to you.</p>



<p><strong>Ring Signatures</strong>: A ring signature is a way to make sure a transaction can&#8217;t be tied back to a specific individual. Think about this example…Imagine a million $100 notes with a thousand fingerprints on each note. It would be impossible to tie the note to a single person. As you transact through the network, it mixes the public information of hundreds of transactions. (Your money is still yours. It&#8217;s never commingled with anyone else&#8217;s.) A $100 bill with 100 sets of fingerprints on it, and yours is one of those sets. There&#8217;s no way anyone can tie that $100 bill back to you. That&#8217;s how ring signatures work. With each transaction, digital fingerprints (called signatures) are attached to the transaction… effectively making it impossible for anyone to conclusively prove that the transaction came from you.</p>



<p><strong>Public-View Key:</strong>&nbsp;The public-view key feature is what separates Monero from any other privacy solution. You can share your public-view key so other people can see your transactions. Here&#8217;s why this is a powerful feature. A common knock against bitcoin is that it&#8217;s too open. Banks and brokers like the low costs of using a blockchain but are concerned by how easy it is to track transactions. They fear competitors might use that knowledge to poach clients. At the same time, regulators support banks adopting the blockchain because it makes auditing them easier. Monero&#8217;s public-view key feature solves this problem. It gives banks total transactional secrecy plus complete openness with the regulators via the public-view key. With the public-view key, regulators can view all of the transactions.</p>



<p><strong>Limited Supply</strong>: Unlike traditional currency, Monero will have a set coin supply and programmed inflation rate. This ensures that the value of Monero cannot be diluted by endless money creation. Over the next eight years, the supply of mined coins will be 18.4 million coins. (As of this writing, 14,546,692 coins have been mined.) After eight years, Monero will adopt a 0.86% annual inflation rate. This ensures a steady supply of coins to compensate miners for maintaining the Monero network.</p>



<p><strong>Built-in Scalability</strong>: Another big knock against bitcoin is that it limits each block&#8217;s size in the blockchain to just 1 megabyte. As bitcoin has grown, the block sizes have stayed the same. This has caused the bitcoin network to slow down. It just can&#8217;t handle a lot of transactions at once. For instance, the Visa payment network can handle up to 56,000 transactions per second. By comparison, bitcoin can only handle seven per second.</p>



<p>Monero has no such preprogrammed limit. It&#8217;s designed with a &#8220;look-back&#8221; window. That means the network reviews the initial transactions and automatically adjusts the blocks&#8217; size to account for transaction volume.</p>



<p>That makes Monero scalable. And that means as more people use Monero, it will be able to overgrow.</p>



<p><strong>How to Mine Monero</strong></p>



<p>Monero runs on all leading O.S. platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and FreeBSD. The currency supports a mining process where individuals get rewarded for their activities by joining mining pools or mine coins individually.</p>



<p>Monero mining can be performed on a standard computer and does not need any specific hardware, such as the application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). An ASIC is a costly form of hardware that is commonly used to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Instead, you can use the CPU or GPU of your computer to mine the currency. A full list of hardware that can be used is available on the Monero website;<a target="_blank" href="https://mymonero.com/#/" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://mymonero.com</a>. Users can also install certain software, which may cost a developer fee.</p>



<p>According to the company&#8217;s website, Monero relies on proof-of-work mining. This is an algorithm that provides security to certain cryptocurrencies like Monero. This system prevents double-spending problems, which can skew the supply, showing there&#8217;s much more than actually available.</p>



<p>Purchasing the currency is as easy as going on an exchange or looking for a seller who&#8217;s willing to unload their supply. You can also buy Monero through an automated teller machine (ATM) that is enabled for cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>You don&#8217;t need any special hardware to mine Monero. The currency runs on all major operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and FreeBSD.</p>



<p><strong>DISADVANTAGES OF MONERO</strong></p>



<p>Despite the many advantages of Monero, it is also plagued by a few disadvantages, some of which are:</p>



<ul><li>Just a few cryptocurrency wallets support Monero, seeing no many developed wallets fashioned for this digital currency.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Monero is also confronted by the mining process&#8217;s centralization, where a few miners are in charge of the mining.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Due to the lack of adequate wallets for Monero, its storage is quite tedious, which makes it very challenging for most users.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Having Monero based applications is also challenging because it is not based on the very popular Blockchains.</li></ul>



<p><strong>PERSPECTIVES AND TAKEAWAYS</strong></p>



<p>Monero was created to be more than a regular cryptocurrency. Rather, it was designed to help solve the problem that different users face while carrying out financial transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a privacy coin, Monero is the cryptocurrency of the future. It helps ensure that anonymity is maintained during transactions, eliminating the privacy challenges in the cryptocurrency industry and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t just make digital transactions seamless but also makes them fully secured and private, which is exactly what many people are looking for in the crypto space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Monero is the best of its kind and is functioning effectively, releasing great benefits to its users.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Monero FAQs</strong></p>



<p><strong>Is Monero Illegal?</strong></p>



<p>Monero is not an illegal cryptocurrency. Unlike others, it is a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency that provides users with anonymity. This means it is not traceable. However, this characteristic makes it very popular on the darknet and for use with certain activities such as gambling and the sale of drugs.</p>



<p><strong>Is Monero a Good Investment?</strong></p>



<p>If you&#8217;re interested in cryptocurrencies, Monero may be a good investment. The currency price jumped more than 137% between Jan. 15, 2020, and Jan. 15, 2021. Additionally, it doesn&#8217;t cost much to start, as you don&#8217;t need any special hardware. You can use the CPU of your computer to mine it, and Monero works with all major operating systems. This will save you a lot of money in fees.</p>



<p><strong>Where Can I Buy Monero?</strong></p>



<p>You can purchase Monero through a digital or virtual currency exchange. Or you can search for an individual seller or an ATM enabled for cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p><strong>How Long Does It Take to Mine One Monero?</strong></p>



<p>It can take about two minutes to mine one coin, although there is no maximum block size.1&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Can XMR Be Traced?</strong></p>



<p>Monero, or XMR, is untraceable. Unlike other coins, such as Bitcoin, Monero has a non-traceable transaction history. This characteristic offers participants a much safer network where they don&#8217;t run the risk of having their held units be refused or blacklisted by others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Bottom Line</p>



<p>Cryptocurrencies are a very popular investment for many people. But the popularity and price of Bitcoin may be a turnoff. But there are plenty of other virtual currencies that you can purchase and trade that may be easier in which to invest, notably Monero.</p>



<p>The privacy-rich attributes have helped Monero become one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the world based on its market capitalization as of January 2021, according to CoinMarketCap. Investors can trade in Monero on leading cryptocurrency exchanges like Kraken, Poloniex, and Bitfinex. However, it&#8217;s important to remember that what makes Monero so popular—namely, its privacy features—can also lead to some major challenges, such as its use in illegal activities.</p>



<p>Investing in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (&#8220;ICOs&#8221;) is highly risky and speculative. This article is not a recommendation by the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs. Since each individual&#8217;s situation is unique, a qualified professional should always be consulted before making any financial decisions.</p>

<p>UNI is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain that offers control over the Uniswap protocol&#8217;s governance<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-uniswap" rel="noreferrer noopener">.</a></p>



<p>Uniswap is an automated market maker (AMM) platform and decentralized exchange (DEX), built on the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-ethereum-blockchain" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum network,</a>&nbsp;which offers a non-custodial trade of ERC-20 tokens. Below we explain what a DEX and an AMM are. The first version (Uniswap v1) was released in November 2018, and the second (Uniswap v2) was released in May 2020.</p>



<p>Uniswap v1 only accepts ERC-20 token exchange. Uniswap v2 allows many groups like USDC / BUSD, DAI / KNC, or DAI / ETH. The aggregation of unique pairings can lead to fewer &#8220;trade-offs&#8221; from a user&#8217;s perspective, ultimately improving price execution by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/ethereum-network-fees" rel="noreferrer noopener">reducing gas commissions,</a>&nbsp;liquidity fees, and slippage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Uniswap v2 also includes a protocol change, allowing UNI token holders to charge 0.05% of the exchange fee versus 0.25% for liquidity providers and a new pricing oracle logic, flash exchanges, and a change in the contract architecture.</p>



<p>&nbsp;This post briefly explains how the UNI token works and its usefulness in the DeFi ecosystem.</p>



<h2 id="what-is-uni-coin"><strong>What is UNI Coin?</strong></h2>



<p>UNI was born from the need for Uniswap to provide its users the possibility of earning tokens by injecting liquidity into the protocol.</p>



<p>On September 16, 2020, the launch was made through an airdrop to Uniswap users who had interacted with the platform before September 1, either through swapping tokens or providing liquidity.</p>



<p>The first use case of the UNI token is that it is used as a governance token. This allows all UNI holders to vote on key issues that can have a serious impact on the direction Uniswap takes, which will surely impact the token price. Also, the management of the treasury will be in charge of the community.</p>



<p>The UNI token also provides liquidity on Uniswap, as liquidity providers (LPs) can provide their UNI along with an equivalent amount of ETH.</p>



<p>Uniswap showed a marked growth after the launch of the second version of its protocol, where UNI is created with a genesis issuance of 1 billion tokens that will be distributed over four years. 40% goes to investors and advisers and the team members themselves. The remaining 60% goes to members of the project community. After that, the project will see an inflation rate of 2% per year. All users who had used any Uniswap service before September 1, 2020, received 400 UNIs worth about $ 4.25, a total of about $ 1,700. Today&#8217;s market price for a UNI is $ 4.88.</p>



<h2 id="brief-history"><strong>Brief History</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/history-of-uniswap-min-1920x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33817" ></figure>



<p>The Uniswap project starts after a series of posts made by Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, especially on his Reddit account, in the years 2017/18. He suggested creating a DEX on Ethereum and spoke of something unknown until then, which were the automated market makers, AMM.</p>



<p>These ideas were collected by Hayden Adams to create Uniswap and transform it into what is today, one of Ethereum&#8217;s largest DeFi ecosystems. Hayden Adams is an expert in simulation and design in the automotive and aerospace industries. You can see his LinkedIn profile&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/haydenadams/" rel="noreferrer noopener">at this link</a>.<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/haydenadams/" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;</a></p>



<h2 id="uni-technology"><strong>UNI Technology</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/uniswap-exchange-liquidity-min-1920x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33828" ></figure>



<p>UniSwap uses an algorithm that automatically assigns the applicable exchange rate based on the relationship between tokens and exchange demand.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s define some basic concepts.</p>



<p>• What is a DEX? A DEX is a decentralized exchange. The difference with a centralized exchange is that, in a DEX, the swap operation is carried out in a decentralized way through smart contracts, without a centralizing entity to guarantee the operation. The custody of the coins is the responsibility of the owner.</p>



<p>• What is an AMM? In traditional markets, there is the figure of the &#8220;market maker,&#8221; which is a person or entity that injects money into a market to activate it. Most often, it is a bank or financial institution. An AMM represents this figure but in a decentralized way. Uniswap&#8217;s AMM works under an original design called CPMM, Constant Product Market Maker. A user can deposit his/her cryptos in a pool through a pair, for example, DAI / ETH, and that money can be used by another user to make another trade. In return, the liquidity provider receives part of the transaction fees in proportion to the money contributed. This was the basis for Uniswap&#8217;s spectacular growth, giving rise to the phenomenon known as liquidity mining. The formula is very simple x * y = k, where &#8220;x&#8221; and &#8220;y&#8221; are the deposited amounts of the pair of cryptocurrencies, and &#8220;k&#8221; is a constant.</p>



<p>• What is a liquidity pool? It is a reserve of funds created by the deposits of contributors who seek profitability for their cryptocurrencies. The objective of Uniswap is to obtain liquidity from some users so that others carry out their operations without depending on anyone. Uniswap design allows users to create pools of liquidity with which traders can quickly trade. A user can deposit his/her cryptocurrencies in a liquidity pool (e.g., DAI / ETH), and that money is used by other people who want to make exchanges. In return, depositors receive part of the transaction fees depending on the amount they have deposited.</p>



<p>This particular operation led Uniswap to reach incredible volumes since this injection of liquidity means more profits for users, giving rise to a very fashionable phenomenon at the moment: liquidity mining. In this way, a win-win is generated: traders experience better transactions, and depositors in pools take commissions for providing liquidity.</p>



<p>These pools are configured so that the depositor must enter two tokens (e.g., ETH and DAI). The purpose of this is to create a balanced and balanced liquidity system that allows the creation of interesting exchange options for the platform&#8217;s users.</p>



<p>Thus, if liquidity providers open a DAI / ETH pool, they must deposit value in both DAI and ETH. Once the pool is created, it will be listed so that users can exchange that pair.</p>



<h2 id="advantages-of-uniswap"><strong>Advantages of Uniswap</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  alt="" ></figure>



<p>&#8211; It is decentralized.</p>



<p>&#8211; Any ERC-20 token can be exchanged.</p>



<p>&#8211; It is open source.</p>



<p>&#8211; Trading is relatively inexpensive.</p>



<p>&#8211; Liquidity pools offer good returns for depositors.</p>



<h2 id="disadvantages-of-uniswap"><strong>Disadvantages of Uniswap</strong></h2>



<p>Like most DeFi initiatives, the protocol is in an experimental phase, so the risk is high.</p>



<p>&#8211; Ethereum&#8217;s scalability problems make the price of gas very high.</p>



<p>&#8211; The UNI token is distributed and traded as security. This could serve as an argument for possible intervention by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>&#8211; It is possible to list fake tokens. You need to be very alert.</p>



<h2 id="perspectives-and-takeaways"><strong>Perspectives and Takeaways</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  alt="" ></figure>



<p>The advent of government tokens has incentivized members across the cryptocurrency industry to educate themselves and pushed the concept of DEX as a whole. In monetary terms, they are also why the crypto industry has gone from $ 1 billion total locked value (TLV) in DeFi at the end of 2019 to well over $ 13.5 billion at the end of 2020.</p>



<p>Uniswap was very timely in launching its UNI government token because DeFi faces many challenges. DeFi is the most competitive industry on the planet. Ethereum is enduring great pressure caused by network congestion, and the current price of gas is unbearable. If Ethereum 2.0 doesn&#8217;t show quick results, the industry will surely be looking for new blockchains to trade on.</p>



<p>That is why the community&#8217;s vote is very necessary since the interested parties themselves will seek the best solution for their money.</p>



<p>The introduction of the UNI token and the massive airdrop, in a way, was expected by the market. This new asset allows the platform to have an internal governance mechanism. Something like a loyalty program mixed with company shares: Uniswap users receive rewards for contributing to the platform, as well as a vote on how the protocol is executed.</p>



<p>Uniswap grew a lot as a decentralized exchange (DEX) after the launch of the second version of this protocol v2, where UNI is created with a genesis issuance of 1 billion tokens distributed over four years. UNI hodlers can submit a governance proposal in the initial stages of governance, delegating 1% of the total UNI supply, i.e., 10,000,000 UNI tokens.</p>



<p>The first use case of the UNI token is that it is used as a governance token. This allows all UNI holders to vote on key issues that can have a serious impact on the direction Uniswap takes, which can ultimately have a huge impact on price action (PA). The treasury will be managed by the community, which is very good news for UNI holders.</p>



<p>The UNI token also provides liquidity on Uniswap, as liquidity providers can provide their UNI along with an equivalent amount of ETH to take a portion of all fees paid when a user buys or sells tokens.</p>



<p>Several analysts consider that UNI&#8217;s launch by Uniswap is a direct response to its recent competitor SushiSwap. This protocol copied Uniswap and took a lot of activity out of it. Uniswap and SushiSwap have the fourth and fifth-highest value blocked in their protocols, respectively.</p>



<p>As a note of color, following the airdrop, Uniswap and UNI moved $ 650,000 in&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/ethereum-network-fees" rel="noreferrer noopener">gas rates</a>&nbsp;in just three hours. The Ethereum network went berserk, and fees soared. Ethereum miners had a new record for combined revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;The recent announcement of the imminent release of UniSwap v3 also caused great anticipation. Uniswap v3 is an update that has been rumored for a long time.</p>



<p>Uniswap announced in August an $ 11 million Series A round led by Andreessen Horowitz with additional investments from USV, Paradigm, Variation A single, Variant, Parafi Cash, SV Angel, and A.Funds. The premise of the Series A round was to provide the team with the resources to &#8220;grow and build Uniswap V3, which will greatly increase the flexibility and efficiency of the protocol capital.&#8221;</p>



<p>While there have been no official announcements of the update, various members of the Ethereum community have been creating quite a stir on Twitter lately by posting analysis of what is about to happen.</p>



<p>In the founder&#8217;s words, this new version will focus on the lag and efficiency issues currently facing Uniswap v2 users.</p>



<p>No specific details have been released on how this will be achieved. Still, the Uniswap founder mentioned dynamic trading fees, the ability to create trading pairs without the participation of both sides of the market, and extremely low slippage levels.</p>



<p>The development team also intends to make Uniswap easier to use by including its educational content.</p>

Atomic Wallet provides you with one of the best options to manage and exchange UNI. Install the app now and manage your UNI right in the Atomic Interface.</p>



<p><strong>8. Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>Uniswap is undoubtedly one of the most important decentralized Ethereum applications. A decentralized exchange powered by an automated market-making system has quickly become the largest consumer of gas on the blockchain. Uniswap regularly processes more than 100,000 transactions with a volume of hundreds of millions each day.</p>



<p>&nbsp;UniSwap has proven to be one of the flagship products in an ultra-competitive environment such as DeFi. I believe that the team will continue to develop new solutions on an ongoing basis. The v3 update is already on the way. Number One Hayden Adams has stated that the new v3 version &#8220;will eat UniSwap v2&#8217;s lunch&#8221;. I think UniSwap is going to remain at the forefront of the DEX race for a long time.</p>

<h3 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>The cryptocurrency space is ever-changing and evolving, and as such, sometimes it isn&#8217;t easy to keep track of everything that&#8217;s occurring. However, one recent piece of news that has been on everyone&#8217;s lip is Ripple&#8217;s cryptocurrency lawsuit regarding XRP, which the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) believes is security. The SEC is a U.S. body created to oversee various markets, protect investors and the national banking system. Their main aim is to prevent the manipulation of markets by companies.</p>



<p>Ripple was founded in 2012 and operated in San Francisco as RippleNet and XRP payment protocol. Ripple&#8217;s XRP would be one of the most popular and one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap today, if you didn&#8217;t know already. Recently, things began looking grim due to the lawsuit handed down to the CEO. As a result, XRP was slightly pushed from the third spot maintained for a very long time. So what&#8217;s going on with this case, you might ask? Frankly, that&#8217;s what will be looked at throughout this article &#8211; and why this is the biggest and most talked-about cryptocurrency trial in history.</p>



<p>The real deal and meat of the matter here is that the SEC is suing Ripple for an allegedly USD 1.3 billion sale of its cryptocurrencies while not registered as a security in 2013. Therefore, the SEC is highlighting that Ripple&#8217;s XRP is deemed a security and should be treated as such, which is why they are in breach of the law and regulatory acts.</p>



<h3 id="ripple-s-xrp-is-it-a-currency-or-a-security"><strong>Ripple’s XRP- Is it a Currency or a Security?</strong></h3>



<p>When we think of this question as to whether XRP is a currency or security, it also brings about other questions. Is it a currency that can be used, such as the dollar or gold, or is it unregistered security that is tradable, similar to stocks, or bonds as alleged by the SEC? If we determined the answer to this question, Ripple would be a security. This is because it was already declared by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network back in 2015.</p>



<p>Subsequently, this brings about some other controversial questions because if it was already declared a security, you might be wondering why Ripple continued with its actions. Nonetheless, that is not very easy to answer because Ripple has various customers in many different jurisdictions. Some countries already also declared that XRP is not secure, such as Japan, for instance. Ripple also stated that their XRP ledger is open source and has a growing community similar to other cryptocurrency projects like Ethereum.</p>



<h3 id="why-is-the-sec-suing-ripple"><strong>Why is the SEC Suing Ripple?</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sec-vs-ripple-xrp-2-1920x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33587" ></figure>



<p>One aspect to take note of is the fact that Ripple is the company that is currently being sued by the SEC, and XRP is the cryptocurrency. In essence, the notion that the SEC is proposing as to why they are suing XRP; is the fact that XRP is a security and not a currency; nonetheless, on the other hand, Ripple is holding a different stance on the matter. Another pointer here is that one of the main reasons the company issued is that they allegedly sold over 1 billion tokens and promoted XRP by paying companies or bodies to aid in this act. These activities were done back in 2013. Currently, there is a lot of speculation: why the SEC allowed Ripple to function as a currency for more than eight years, and now the company is slapped with one of the most significant lawsuits in history.</p>



<p>The SEC also disclosed that Ripple sold these unregistered securities to U.S. customers and other countries across the globe. This complaint was filed in the federal district court in Manhattan after the SEC&#8217;s research and investigation team put the evidence together to present it before the courts. Both Ripple and two of their executives are currently being sued, namely, Christian Larsen and Bradley Garlinghouse.</p>



<p>Upon announcing the news to the cryptocurrency community, XRP fell more than 30% in a single day, and this certainly caught most traders and holders off guard. Many significant companies who also had holdings in XRP, such as Grayscale, liquidated or sold their positions a few days after the news broke.</p>



<h3 id="other-lawsuits-with-cryptocurrencies"><strong>Other Lawsuits with Cryptocurrencies</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lawsuit-crypto-1-1920x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33609" ></figure>



<p>With new technology, there will always be difficulties for governments and other individuals to accept and get on board. Cryptocurrencies are one such asset class that has been scrutinized much from their inception. As a result of this, there have been numerous lawsuits with many other cryptocurrency projects other than Ripple. Likewise, some of these same cases are currently still in session at the time of writing.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not strange that there will be difficulties for CEOs of various cryptocurrencies to know what guidelines they should adhere to since there is little to no regulation. This is primarily because the crypto space is emerging, and regulators have difficulty finding a flat ground with these new assets. Two other popular cryptocurrencies with lawsuits were Kik Interactive Inc over Kik Messenger&#8217;s KIN token and Telegram&#8217;s GRAM token ICO. Well-known CEOs of messaging application companies created these two projects. However, their projects were terminated due to regulatory issues and lawsuits against them.</p>



<p>Kik is a popular messaging app used by many individuals in the eastern world, its largest market. In 2017, the company made an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) sell tokens to the public. The SEC stated that the tokens&#8217; selling was illegal because Kik offered and sold tokens to U.S. investors without undergoing the necessary steps to do so. They did not register the sale as security either. Therefore, it was deemed illegal hence they were sued for over 5 million USD in a filing by the SEC in 2019. The case was finally settled in October 2020.</p>



<p>In the same light, Lantah LLC was furious over the GRAM ticker&#8217;s use by Telegram- one of the most popular communication and team applications. This led to them getting their fair share of legal discipline from the SEC as well. While the Securities and Exchange Commission was not too harsh with their delicate, they were ordered to pay over 625 million USD to Lantah LLC. This lawsuit brewed from the token sale of the GRAM tokens sold by Telegram in 2018 and raised over 1.7 billion USD in an ICO.</p>



<p>The lawsuit ended with Telegram losing because the SEC investigated and found out that they raised money illegally since they were not registered as a security. Since the lawsuit, Telegram has abandoned the TON project and said that they no longer need to use the GRAM ticker. They also refunded over 70% of all investors&#8217; funds in 2018. Additionally, Telegram agreed to pay the SEC 18.5 million USD as a civil penalty to settle the case. The company will also notify the SEC if they plan to offer any digital asset type soon.</p>



<h3 id="what-are-the-boundaries-regarding-regulations"><strong>What are the Boundaries Regarding Regulations?</strong></h3>



<p>While Congress has the ultimate power in making the rules and laws governing these new asset classes, there is little that they have said about cryptocurrencies. This in itself poses a threat for these assets since it is then left down to the mercy of independent regulators to use their discretion to determine what steps to take. Since the U.S. Congress is not making any rules and regulations, it is unclear what their stance is regarding cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>In Ripple&#8217;s case, it seems that the goal of the SEC is to support consumers and prevent them from getting harmed from an investment such as the XRP cryptocurrency. In the past, though, the regulatory bodies aimed to protect Silicon Valley giants and help consumers, which was enforced by the Obama Federal Communications Commission (FCC). As we all know, with new leaders, there are new rules that are also one reason why Ripple finds itself in this current situation.</p>



<h3 id="what-strategies-does-the-us-adopt-for-cryptocurrency-and-blockchain-tech"><strong>What Strategies Does the US Adopt for Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Tech?</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/us-regulation-1-1920x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33598" ></figure>



<p>Many countries have accepted blockchain technology and adopted cryptocurrencies; however, in the United States, things are a bit different for the most part. There is very little being done to accept blockchain and cryptocurrency technology. Additionally, the little strategies they have employed are not enough to facilitate this emerging asset class&#8217;s growth and mass adoption. Some of the strategies that the U.S. adopts are not mind-blowing, but more can be done for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.</p>



<p>One of the good things here is that the United States has not openly banned Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies &#8211; More can certainly be done in terms of strategies for crypto mass adoption, though. Secondly, there are numerous blockchain and crypto-related companies in the U.S. that are allowed to operate despite not being a traditional business. This means that there is a similar ground for new blockchain businesses to operate somewhat freely in the U.S.</p>



<p>Finally, some states are more fond of cryptocurrencies to the point where they can be used as a means of payment. Some of the most cryptocurrency-friendly states include Texas, Ohio, Colorado, and Wyoming. As mentioned before, this is certainly not groundbreaking for a first-world country like the United States; nonetheless, it is a good leap forward in the right direction. They seek to find more strategies that they can utilize to handle blockchain technology.</p>



<p>While these steps are not the only things that can be done to adopt cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, it is evident that more work needs to be done. On the other hand, the conflicting and contradicting approach that U.S. regulatory bodies are taking; makes it even more difficult for the country and government to develop more concrete strategies to adopt cryptocurrencies. Many other countries, such as China, are way ahead of the game and are making it their duty to help pilot the transition from fiat to a digital dollar.</p>



<p>Regarding the Ripple lawsuit, this might be one of how the U.S. loses the digital race. So how will this happen? Put, if emerging blockchain and cryptocurrency companies fear what happened to Ripple, they will either forget about their contribution to adopting the technology or migrate to other cryptocurrency-friendly nations. As a result, this will lead to more innovations for other countries such as China, which will benefit significantly by dominating these technologies.</p>



<h3 id="should-regulators-be-protecting-china-or-us-customers"><strong>Should Regulators be Protecting China or US Customers?</strong></h3>



<p>Regulation is vital in any emerging market since it will help lay down the rules and laws regarding how businesses and individuals should operate. With regards to the U.S., it is clear that regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lean more towards protecting the customer than anyone else. On the other side of the spectrum, though, it is clear that the SEC did not have any issues with numerous Chinese firms that currently value more than 2.2 trillion to list on U.S. exchanges. Furthermore, these firms did not undergo any form of audit or disclosures for U.S. investors exposed. These events have also been occurring for more than two decades now, and there is nothing that the SEC did to penalize these companies.</p>



<p>Thus, this presents another issue as the U.S. will be willing to adopt cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. They should be protecting U.S. customers at all costs, but this is not the case. So how is it that they seem to be more lenient towards some companies, yet Ripple faces one of the most significant and most challenging lawsuits in history? This shows that China is most likely flourishing in the U.S. financial markets while it is the latter for most US-based cryptocurrency companies trying to get a breakthrough in the industry.</p>



<h3 id="is-ripple-fighting-a-losing-battle"><strong>Is Ripple Fighting a Losing Battle?</strong></h3>



<p>If we should backtrack a bit and take a look at the previous lawsuits with the Securities and Exchange Commission; the shocking truth is that they have hardly ever lost any lawsuit with various individuals or companies that they believe have violated regulations regarding the U.S. monetary or banking system and manipulated the markets to their benefit. While there is no way for us to know if Ripple will lose the lawsuit honestly, the history shows that the SEC is not a body that &#8216;goes down very quickly in a court battle. In the end, the world will have to wait to see what the courts determine to be Ripple&#8217;s faith and what it will mean for similar cryptocurrencies and other blockchain startups.</p>



<p>Hypothetically, if Ripple is indeed successful and the courts agree that it is not a security, this would be excellent news for the entire cryptocurrency space and particularly holders of XRP. First and foremost, winning an SEC battle has a massive amount of weight to it, and that would most likely be the signal that XRP is indeed the global payment solution and cryptocurrency of the future. Nonetheless, the most that we can do at this point is wait and see what grounds both parties will have to settle on. This case will most likely be ongoing for a great deal of time, so a resolution might not be anywhere in sight for 2021.</p>



<h3 id="final-thoughts"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3>



<p>Every day, it gets more evident that blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are the future, and Ripple&#8217;s XRP is one cryptocurrency that the industry believes is important for mass adoption. It has low transaction fees to facilitate moving large amounts of money from one border to the next. Despite the current lawsuit, customers are still drawn to Ripple&#8217;s XRP cryptocurrency as they seek new ways to manage their finances. By using cryptocurrencies such as XRP, individuals have the freedom of having a bank in their pockets and can send and receive payments across the globe.</p>



<p>It is also evident here that this is not the first time the SEC has hit cryptocurrencies with lawsuits. Other than negatively affecting the token price, the entire space is also affected when these things happen. When the case is settled at the end of the trial, it still does not mean that Ripple will be allowed to carry out every objective that the team had for XRP, which is not suitable for the space or holders of the XRP cryptocurrency. Ripple&#8217;s CEO- Brad Garlinghouse, brought to the media&#8217;s attention that the SEC allowed XRP to be operated as a currency for close to a decade and is now saying that it is a security. He also made it clear that they do not foster innovation and growth in the U.S.</p>

<p>Started as a &#8220;prank&#8221; cryptocurrency, Dogecoin managed to hit the headlines right after Gamestop&#8217;s (GME) rally, gaining the Reddit community full support.</p>



<p>This article will try to outline the history and vantage points of the most famous dog-friendly (pun intended) meme coin in the cryptocurrency world, which both Reddit investors &amp; Elon Musk want to &#8220;fly to the moon.&#8221;</p>



<h3 id="a-shibe-star-is-born"><strong>A Shibe Star is Born…</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dogecoin-born.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33910" ></figure>



<p>For those readers who are well-versed with history &#8211; especially with the Medieval and Renaissance periods of the Venetian Republic &#8211; it may be worth noting that the coin&#8217;s name &#8220;Doge&#8221; is entirely unrelated. Instead, Dogecoin pays homage to what is probably one of the most persistent and resilient memes in web lore history.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image8.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33375" ></figure>



<p>Born as a seeming malapropism of the word &#8220;dog,&#8221; the Doge is a cute Shiba Inu (commonly called &#8220;Shibe&#8221; in the crypto space) that&#8217;s almost always depicted with a vaguely gobsmacked expression. This dog is often coupled with some vignette/interior monologue, whose selected characters&#8217; font is strictly in Comic Sans.</p>



<p>For the sake of completeness, the Shiba Inu, who&#8217;s lent its expressive muzzle to the internet memes that are raging throughout the Web,&nbsp;<strong>does</strong>&nbsp;genuinely exist. Its name is Kabosu and bears quite a heroic background and past: he is one of the few Shibas, in his litter, having survived a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppy_mill" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8216;Puppy Mill&#8217; ordeal</a>, before being rescued from almost spelled death by Japanese nursery school Atsuko Sato in 2008.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image4-1.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33386" ></figure>



<p>Two years after, Sato decided to share some pictures, of her and Kabosu, on the Web. It was one of these fatal shots that managed to catch the Internet community&#8217;s attention, decreeing the meme&#8217;s birth that&#8217;s been raging both in the crypto space, especially in the past years, weeks, days.<br></p>



<p>(By the way, despite more than ten years have passed since that fateful picture having been uploaded on the Web, it seems Kabosu is still alive and well, having reached a venerable age by now. Wow. Much Reverence).</p>



<h3 id="d-is-for-dogecoin-nbsp"><strong>Ð is for Ðogecoin&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/d-is-for-dogecoin.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33921" ></figure>



<p>The definitive twist came when Billy Markus, an IBM engineer, and Jackson Palmer, an Australian software engineer and employee of the Adobe The definitive twist came when Billy Markus, an IBM engineer, and Jackson Palmer, an Australian software engineer and employee of the Adobe Systems Marketing Department (one of the biggest tech firms in the world at the time) conceived &#8211; at least initially &#8211; the pranky idea of creating a crypto coin that would combine two of the most discussed topics on the Internet: cryptocurrencies and dogs. «Invest in Dogecoin. I am pretty sure it will be the next big thing», that&#8217;s what Markus had tweeted in what could be considered a moment of boredom. The joking tweet and reference to Dogecoin &#8211; which still had not yet been created by Markus and Palmer &#8211; was meant to target/criticize when new cryptocurrencies were being launched by the day, many of which had no intrinsic value or solid fundamentals, according to Palmer.</p>



<p>But we all know that fate loves irony, and that&#8217;s how a tweet about a crypto coin that was meant to be a prank managed instead to gain a lot of attention, traction &amp; followers. The same followers then encouraged Palmer and Markus to implement Dogecoin&#8217;s creation. Shortly after the tweet, dogecoin.com was born, and the website received more than 1 million visitors in the first month since its initial launch.</p>



<p>Palmer&#8217;s tweet was then taken seriously by many crypto investors and fans, who decided, from that moment on, to fully embrace &#8220;the Doge&#8221; as one of their favorite cryptocurrencies, acclaiming it as &#8220;the next big thing&#8221; in the crypto-financial sector.<br>I</p>



<p>n the wake of this success, Palmer and his associate decided to build upon the public acclaim and validation by purchasing the dogecoin.com domain and creating the primogenitor Doge&#8217;s &#8220;viral logo,&#8221; as we know it today.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image5.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33397" ></figure>



<p>The project was put to fruition in a short time but, despite Palmer and Markus riding the wave, they seemingly still considered it a &#8220;game&#8221;: therefore, the project cruised forward placidly &#8211; until social news aggregator Reddit and its community decide to &#8220;adopt&#8221; the $DOGE. Dogecoin&#8217;s subreddit rapidly reached peak subscription numbers and activity levels, thanks to implementing the so-called &#8220;Reddit Tip Bot.&#8221; This tool hugely boosted Dogecoin&#8217;s adoption by rewarding Reddit&#8217;s most active users and original content creators, and &#8211; in a concise amount of time &#8211; Dogecoin&#8217;s circulation bloomed and blossomed: from then on, virtually every Reddit user started earning and collecting his/her $DOGEs and the &#8220;viral spiral&#8221; of the internet meme &amp; crypto communities took over.</p>



<p>Since then, many initiatives have been launched by Dogecoin&#8217;s community of fans &#8211; some crazier than others, some audacious, some quite noble. These included the crowdfunding to help the Jamaican bobsled team join the Soči Winter Olympics, the Doge4Water initiative to help collect donations to build a well in the Tana river basin in Kenya Dogecoin&#8217;s NASCAR sponsorship banner over driver Josh Wise&#8217;s car.</p>



<p>And all these eventful happenings came to be way before Elon Musk &#8220;got elected&#8221; as Dogecoin&#8217;s CEO.</p>



<h3 id="all-hail-the-new-ceo"><strong>“All Hail The New CEO!”</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/elon-musk-dogecoin-ceo.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33932" ></figure>



<p>The last sentence in the previous paragraph deserves some clarification, especially for anyone that, quite understandably, knows Elon Musk is renownedly Tesla and SpaceX CEO, but not Dogecoin&#8217;s. When did that happen?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image9.jpg"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33408" ></figure>



<p>Elon Musk&#8217;s &#8220;first contact&#8221; with Dogecoin&#8217;s creator Jackson Palmer probably dated back to September 2018 and was unrelated to $DOGE &#8211;&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1041572165898792961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1041572165898792961%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fhardfork%2F2018%2F09%2F17%2Fmusk-twitter-scambots-dogecoin%2F" rel="noreferrer noopener">Musk asked Palmer&#8217;s aid</a>&nbsp;to get rid of malicious bots impersonating him after a cryptocurrency scam bot virus was raging throughout Twitter. Palmer was called to arms &#8211; or so to speak &#8211; having developed a script in the past that would help solve the long-standing issue.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image3-1.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33419" ></figure>



<p>The change in attitude and the internet culture&#8217;s validation, tributed by meme and crypto communities to Elon Musk as Dogecoin&#8217;s CEO, dates back to a 2019 &#8220;prank-styled,&#8221; renowned poll, launched by Dogecoin&#8217;s official Twitter account on April Fools&#8217; day, which saw&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/dogecoin/status/1112756919951859712?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elon emerge victorious as the surveyed-elected and undisputed leader</a>&nbsp;of the most famous dog coin of the Web, getting the most preferences (over 4,000 thousand votes) and sympathies over notable opposing candidates, such as Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum founder), Marshall Hayner (Metal Pay&#8217;s Founder and CEO) and Charlie Lee (Litecoin&#8217;s founder).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image6-1.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33430" ></figure>



<p>Musk was already known as a tech futurist and paper money disbeliever &#8211; who in past comments, described BTC as &#8220;a brilliant thing&#8221; &#8211; and, in response to the poll, contributed to the hype&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1113009339743100929?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener">by commenting</a>&nbsp;and almost accepting the &#8220;public nomination&#8221;:&nbsp;</p>



<p>«Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It&#8217;s pretty cool.»</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image14.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33441" ></figure>



<p>Musk was also apparently very proud of the crypto community’s Musk was also apparently very proud of the crypto community&#8217;s nomination and the faith he was entrusted with. Following the fateful event, he even changed his Twitter header bio to &#8220;CEO of Dogecoin,&#8221;&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1113173498384441344?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener">followed by a tweet with a picture of a Shiba Inu with the caption &#8220;Dogecoin Rulz</a>.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image2.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33452" ></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image1-1.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33463" ></figure>



<p>That&#8217;s how it all began, and many would controversially agree that Musk took his newly appointed role very seriously, reminding DOGE&#8217;s fans, from time to time, that he&#8217;s duly supporting the coin with tweets and pranky (sometimes trollish) memes and promoting the most famous Shiba Inu in the world.</p>



<h3 id="the-beginning-of-a-new-paradigm"><strong>The Beginning of a New Paradigm?</strong></h3>



<p>Since 2013, almost a decade has passed. Yet, Dogecoin has never been so popular.</p>



<p>In the past years, several viral campaigns have tried to boost the adoption of $DOGE to reach dollar parity. In 2019 and 2020, it was the turn of a user-based campaign on TikTok &#8211; and at the time $ DOGE&#8217;s value was just around 0,01 dollars, nothing compared to actual prices, which witness Elon Musk &#8220;at the helm of the Dogecoin&#8217;s moon ship.&#8221;</p>



<p>Elon Musk&#8217;s active twitter involvement, especially in recent times, has largely contributed to Dogecoin&#8217;s growth: significant surges in $ DOGE&#8217;s price have occurred each time &#8220;his CEO&#8221; resolved to tweet his appreciation to the world.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image7-1.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33474" ></figure>



<p>It also seems that Elon&#8217;s frequent engagement helped drawing the attention to Dogecoin, not only of the fans, the investors, and the media but also other celebrities, ranging from names such as&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/SnoopDogg/status/1358141965930426368?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener">rap star Snoop Dogg</a>,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/genesimmons/status/1358992775937548290?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener">American songwriter and record producer Gene Simmons</a>&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ANGELAWHITE/status/1345197408448204800?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener">pornstar Angela White</a>, who have spent honeyed, sweet words for the coin, fueling and boosting its price to unprecedented, sky-high levels.</p>



<p>Adding to the narrative, $DOGE also managed to gain the attention of the r/WallStreetBets Reddit community, which &#8211; after&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2021/01/30/gamestop-wont-stop-robinhood-cheats-musk-tweets-hodlers012430" rel="noreferrer noopener">the $GME, $AMC, and Robinhood app uproar</a>&nbsp;&#8211; ingeniously refocused the attention towards Dogecoin, meeting with a more than favorable astral conjunction, which saw in Elon Musk tweets its most shiny starlight supporting the recent price boosts.</p>



<p>On a more general note, many would also argue that the recent Robinhood, GameStop, and Dogecoin events managed to stir the waters profoundly and raise the awareness of both many non-crypto &amp; crypto investors with regards to innovation, reliability, neutrality, and decentralization safety that only blockchain technology can bring, and that traditional finance &#8211; more often than not &#8211; lacks.</p>



<p>In tying in all these happenings together, this analysis couldn&#8217;t possibly be complete without mentioning&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.coindesk.com/tesla-invests-1-5b-in-bitcoin-plans-to-accept-crypto-payments" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elon Musk&#8217;s recent Tesla $1,5 billion acquisition of Bitcoin</a>. In perfect accordance with the extravagant CEO&#8217;s style, the move was preceded by several alluding tweets &#8230;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image10.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33485" ></figure>



<p>… then by the addition of the #Bitcoin hashtag and emoji&nbsp;<strong><em>₿</em></strong>&nbsp;on his bio…</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image12.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33496" ></figure>



<p>…. and, finally, by an official announcement, which reverberated through the media channels throughout the world, sparkling criticisms (among traditional finance vets) and plauds (among crypto supporters) in almost equal measure.</p>



<p>In many ways, the events laid out «the fundamental question» again: does crypto represent a much-needed, natural evolution to help assist and govern the future of our economic, financial, political, and &#8211; maybe partially &#8211; social systems?</p>



<h3 id="8230-to-be-continued"><strong>&#8230;To Be Continued?</strong></h3>



<p>Final Doge note/trivia: on February 15th, Dogecoin&#8217;s value saw a substantial price devaluation, right after Elon Musk criticized the extremely uneven $DOGE distribution, inviting the significant holders to sell a significant share of their coins holding.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image13.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-33507" ></figure>



<p>Various analytics sources show that just 100 addresses hold more than 70% of the whole $DOGE supply. Therefore, the vast majority of $DOGEs are concentrated in the hands of a single holder, while the next ten major holders own more than 50% of the total supply.</p>



<p>Several hours after the tweet, Dogecoin&#8217;s price fell to $0,048, bouncing back to $0,06$ after a general market recovery. That was probably Elon Musk&#8217;s only tweet that supposedly caused a reduction in $ DOGE&#8217;s price.</p>

<p>Without any pretense of completeness, the above was a concise synopsis of how one of the most extravagant, yet undeniably brilliant, business personalities of our times &amp; one of the most loved meme cryptocurrencies in the crypto space managed to get acquainted, intertwine fates, and somehow shape many of the most eventful, recent happenings in the cryptocurrency universe.</p>



<p>Many fateful readers would recognize most of the previously described Elon-Doge events as &#8220;signs&#8221; &#8211; part of a broader «<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect" rel="noreferrer noopener">Butterfly Effect</a>» design &#8211; that would lay the path to the «cryptocurrency-as-the-new-paradigm» future, with Elon Musk playing the Deus-Ex-Machina role.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether that is something that will be true or not, it will surely be worth watching closely. And in any case, the chances are that Shibe will be remembered as the catalyst of the future, unfurling events. In retrospect, it *<strong>will</strong>* be inevitable.</p>

<h3 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>We must admit that hundreds of new cryptocurrencies are deployed in the space almost every day, and while some earn the spotlight; they don&#8217;t do so for long. Yearn.Finance is on a different level, though, and is seen as the magic door to the DeFi space that the mother of smart contracts- Ethereum gave to us. In this article, we will be taking a look at Yearn.Finance or YFI for short. So what is YFI? Well, Yearn.Finance can be thought of as a portal that gives users the ability to access and invest in many different assets and products, all from one platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They bundle decentralized finance (DeFi) products into one package for investors or users. The algorithm then automatically chooses the best rewards upon investing, so investors would effortlessly earn interest in their investments. yEarn was launched on the Ethereum blockchain and had been making waves in the industry ever since its launch. Let&#8217;s take a deep dive further into what YFI or yEarn as it is sometimes referred to. One key thing to note is that Yearn works as a yield aggregating platform by effortlessly maximizing investments for the highest yearly yield or annual percentage yield (APY) possible. The platform allows an investor to enter various vaults or<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/mining-pools" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;pools</a>&nbsp;with ERC20 stablecoins such as DAI, TUSD, USDC, USDT, or SUSD.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="what-is-yearn-finance-company-ledger-and-what-is-yfi-coin-nbsp"><strong>What is Yearn.Finance Company/Ledger and what is YFI Coin?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>You can think of Yearn.Finance Company/Ledger as an all in one blockchain solution to maximize investors&#8217; gains over time. This is done through what is known as&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/staking#:~:text=Staking%20is%20as%20simple%20as,wallet%20to%20generate%20a%20reward." rel="noreferrer noopener">staking&nbsp;</a>or locking up tokens, as mentioned earlier. The company offers various services on its blockchain ledgers like yield farming, coin swapping, profit switching, and insurance. Users of the platform are exposed to all these options and decide on which they want to participate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With most cryptocurrency protocols, there is a coin or tokens associated with the project. In this regard, yEarn adopts the YFI token, which is used to create a standard currency for the platform users can rely on when doing various transactions. Users who lockup their stable coins will earn YFI tokens in return that they can sell on various markets or exchanges. We have mentioned that yield farming is a feature of the Yearn platform, and this is a clear example of what that is. Locking up tokens to earn more YFI is essentially yield farming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="brief-history-of-yearn-finance"><strong>Brief History of Yearn.Finance</strong></h3>



<p>Due to the high quality of the Yearn.Finance project, one would believe that it is not new to the crypto space and have years of development backing it along with the team. While not aiming to &#8216;burst any bubbles&#8217; here as solid and well-built as YFI is, it is a relatively new project but has done extremely well so far. YFI entered the crypto space in little under a year ago, in July 2020. It truly deserves the recognition it is getting thanks to the founder and lead developer of the project- Andre Cronje. He is a well-respected individual who created some of the best projects to date, such as&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://keep3r.network/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Keep3rV1 (KP3R)</a>, for example.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back in July 2020, Yearn.Finance surpassed bitcoin in terms of price but not market cap. It was valued at more than 25,000USD, which attracted a huge crowd to grab a piece of the value of this so-called &#8216;DeFi gem&#8217; at the time. During one particular week, Yearn.Finance grew more than 1000 percent and continued to break new records as the project attracted more investors over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other essential team members lead the project to great success, like @doug and @banteg, which are the social media nicknames associated with these individuals. The team has a much wider range of developers and contributors, which is expected due to the nature and quality of Yearn.Finance. When looking at this team, it&#8217;s no secret that everyone gets along well from the evidence of numerous tweets and the project&#8217;s overall success.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One other crucial aspect that proves this project&#8217;s credibility and robustness is the premium quality partnerships they have lined up. Partners of yEarn include Powertool, Cover Protocol, Aavee Lend, Cream, Sushi Swap, and Akropolis, who are top players in the crypto space and, particularly, the DeFi marketplace. These are only a few of their recent partners since it&#8217;s a relatively new project. It is certainly expected that yEarn will attract a lot more partners in the future.</p>



<h3 id="what-is-yearn-finance-technology-and-advantages-amp-disadvantages"><strong>What is Yearn.Finance Technology and Advantages &amp; Disadvantages?</strong></h3>



<p>Without a doubt, Yearn&#8217;s technology is cutting edge, especially because a user gets exposed to a variety of decentralized finance (DeFi) products. When it comes to decentralized finance in the crypto space, it is very important to every investor since they can multiply their investment. Upon launch, FYI has proved to be a very valuable project that sets the pace for other quality products in the crypto sphere to follow. There are some key advantages and features that make Yearn.Finance important. These will be looked at more in-depth, along with some disadvantages of this particular cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main features of the Yearn platform are unique. Firstly, the platform automatically transfers an investor&#8217;s funds between various platforms such as Compound, Dydx, Curve, or Aave to bring the highest and most profitable returns on their investment. One other feature of this cryptocurrency is the token&#8217;s governance feature, which gives users the ability to vote on upgrades and updates for the project. Not every cryptocurrency allows the input of its token holder in the direction of the project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, Yearn allows users to earn through yield farming. This is the popular way to earn passive income by locking up cryptocurrencies for a particular time. The platform also seeks to ensure that investors are exposed to many products to earn the highest yearly yield that is possible. The vaults are where investors&#8217; funds are held and are similar to a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/mining-pools" rel="noreferrer noopener">poo</a>l of funds contributing to the network.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since many investors have funds in their wallets that they are not using, it just sits there and does not do anything. This is especially true since the cryptocurrency market is very volatile, so investors will be holding stablecoins at some point. If these investors utilize Yearn.Finance gives them a competitive advantage that they can leverage by locking up their stable assets, for instance, and earn interest on them in YFI tokens. Moreover, Yearn. Finance&#8217;s platform exposed investors to a wide variety of decentralized finance (DeFi) products through one platform. Therefore, an advantage of this is that investors can choose a suitable product instead of trying a lot of products on the marketplaces. So this essentially minimizes their risk of investing in a poor quality project.</p>



<p>Even though there are not many downsides to using yEarn, it is important to know that with every project comes some drawback or disadvantage that users must consider before investing. With any staking or locking up of funds on a platform, investors are taking a risk to earn rewards. Of course, if the project is high quality and the team is public, that adds a great amount of credibility, but they still leave some risks involved with market uncertainty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other disadvantage here is that Yearn.Finance is a relatively new project, so that also presents some level of risks to investors. It certainly will need some more time to prove itself. However, it is doing very well at the time of writing. While the future looks bright for this project, we never know exactly what it holds. Hacks are another major drawback that occurs in the crypto space, and though it has been close to a year now, yEarn is still a DeFi project, and these are currently the most hacked in the crypto space. Finally, we need to remember that YFI is considered an experimental platform likewise most of its competitors. This means that there are no guarantees that it will always work as expected, and here lies another type of risk that investors will DeFinitely have to keep in mind.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="perspectives-and-takeaways"><strong>Perspectives and Takeaways</strong></h3>



<p>At this point in the world of crypto, we must look at the fact that it&#8217;s certainly not easy accurately to identify or assess the future path of any project. However, there are some exceptions and Yearn.Finance is one such project. We can safely argue or posit that yEarn has brought all eyes on the DeFi space so that investors can realize that there is a lot of value available for them to tap into. This can only be done through decentralized, high-quality projects such as Yearn, and that&#8217;s what it brings to the table. Furthermore, this allows individuals to manage and maximize their crypto assets by earning interest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As YFI continued to grow and attract more investors over time, it became clearer that it would be in the top 100 projects in a very short space of time. It also got listed on numerous high-quality exchanges with little effort from the founder-Andre Cronje, since centralized exchanges began to realize the value that this project brought to the cryptocurrency space. Yearn.Finance is currently listed on Coinbase Pro, Binance, Huobi, and Kraken, just to name a few. From a theoretical standpoint, it is no secret that projects like YFI are what investors are looking for to have a stable and passive income platform that is generating interest and automatically locating the platforms with the highest return on their investment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the growth and development, the crypto space got introduced to new dimensions and possibilities. Thanks to Yearn.Finance, what we can summarize from this is that the potential of the decentralized finance (DeFi) space is essentially endless. There are no boundaries that innovation must adhere to, and that presents a clear and bright future for cryptocurrencies and particularly Ethereum since it&#8217;s the mother of DeFi.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="yearn-finance-website-twitter-and-other-social-media"><strong>Yearn.Finance (Website, Twitter, and other social media)</strong></h3>



<p>Yearn.Finance is a top-tier project, so it has a lot going on for it, and it&#8217;s certainly not short of a great community. Yearn.Finance social media and accounts can be found by visiting the following links:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/filecoin-fil-explained-1920x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34327" ></figure>



<p>Managing to raise a whopping $257 million from crowd sale in September 2017,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/filecoin-wallet" rel="noreferrer noopener">Filecoin</a>&nbsp;has been building its products for the past three years and finally launched its Mainnet. The Filecoin team is working on creating a decentralized cloud storage and retrieval market, where anyone with free disk space could rent out to clients on the internet and, in return, receive rewards in the FIL token. Find out how Filecoin will revolutionize how data is stored and accessed in the coming years.</p>



<h3 id="what-is-filecoin"><strong>What is Filecoin</strong></h3>



<p>Filecoin is a peer-to-peer, decentralized file storage and sharing network that uses the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-blockchain" rel="noreferrer noopener">blockchain</a>&nbsp;to enable users to rent out their unused storage space in a transparent and reliable marketplace. The Filecoin protocol incentivizes miners to help clients store and retrieve data in a secure fashion.</p>



<p>Clients must pay using the FIL protocol token for data storage while the storage miners and retrieval miners earn FIL for offering store and serving data, respectively. All these integrated processes are executed without any central body&#8217;s involvement, which is contrary to that of the legacy file storage platforms.</p>



<h3 id="brief-history"><strong>Brief History</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/brief-history-of-filecoin-1920x668.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34328" ></figure>



<p>Filecoin was developed on top of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) by Planet Labs in 2017. The IPFS protocol is a peer-to-peer storage network that allows users to host and receive data via a distributed file system without any reward scheme.</p>



<p>Filecoin secured around $257 million in 2017 from its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) plus venture funding making it one of the largest token sales in the history of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-is-cryptocurrency" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryptocurrencies</a>. This drew a lot of attention from the mainstream media and hype around the project.</p>



<p>The project had gone through several stages of development until September 2020 where it launched its Mainnet. In less than a month after a successful Mainnet launch, Filecoin achieved a significant milestone. The network passed 1.1 million TB (terabytes) of storage capacity. According to reports, the network could store 4,500 Wikipedias, 290 million movies at 1080p quality, and 19 copies of the entire Internet Archive.</p>



<h3 id="filecoin-technology-amp-advantages"><strong>Filecoin Technology &amp; Advantages</strong></h3>



<p>Filecoin finds itself in a competitive environment and, as such, needs to bring something of value to the table. With giants in the business like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, Juan Benet, creator of Filecoin, had the vision to build from scratch a sophisticated marketplace for data storage and retrieval using the blockchain.</p>



<p>Centralized data storage solutions are prone to attacks due to their architecture, thus influencing Filecoin to adopt the blockchain to render a more secure and efficient storage service to consumers. The Filecoin protocol relies on four components to operate as intended. Some of the notable innovations and technologies being used by the Filecoin protocol are as follows:</p>



<h3 id="decentralized-storage-network-nbsp-dsn"><strong>Decentralized Storage Network&nbsp;(DSN)</strong></h3>



<p>The DSN scheme is one of the concepts introduced by Filecoin to enable independent storage providers to offer storage space and retrieval services with an incentive model. The Filecoin storage network uses verifiable markets (Storage &amp; Retrieval Markets) to ensure storage providers receive their payment for rendering a storage or retrieval service for a client.</p>



<p>The DNS gathers storage offered by several independent providers and coordinates without assistance from external entities to provide data storage and retrieval to clients.</p>



<h3 id="consensus-mechanism"><strong>Consensus Mechanism</strong></h3>



<p>Filecoin combines two unique consensus mechanisms to achieve its goal of creating a decentralized storage and retrieval network. Filecoin implements the Proof-of-Replication (PoRep) and Proof-of-Spacetime (PoSt)&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/academy/cryptocurrency-algorithm" rel="noreferrer noopener">algorithms</a>.</p>



<p>The PoRep deals with storage providers convincing their respective clients that they have stored replicas of the underlying data paid for their (data provider) physical storage. PoRep is a buildup of previous schemes that were likely to be exploited by malicious miners. PoRep is strategically designed to prevent Sybil, Outsourcing, and Generation attacks.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the Proof-of-Spacetime enables a user to confirm if the agreed term&#8217;s storage provider is storing the outsourced data. This mechanism was introduced because the Proof-of-Storage wasn&#8217;t effective in keeping track of how storage providers store long data.</p>



<h3 id="storage-and-retrieval-markets"><strong>Storage and Retrieval Markets</strong></h3>



<p>These are verifiable markets used to match and settle orders between clients and miners on the Filecoin network. The storage market allows clients to pay storage miners to store data, whereas the retrieval market allows clients to request data by paying retrieval miners to deliver it. Parties involved in a deal are free to set their price and accept offers they deem fit. Filecoin employs a network of full nodes to oversee exchange operations, and guarantees miners get rewarded for the services they render to clients.</p>



<h3 id="smart-contracts"><strong>Smart Contracts</strong></h3>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/smart-contracts" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smart contracts&nbsp;</a>on Filecoin enable users to code stateful programs to perform user-defined operations when certain conditions are met. The smart contract can perform market operations, proof verification, spend tokens, etc.</p>



<p>This has opened an opportunity for complex operations to be executed on the network without supervision. For example, a client could write a contract to reward a miner in a particular fashion. They can also create contracts to update data and several others.</p>



<h3 id="mining-on-filecoin"><strong>Mining on Filecoin</strong></h3>



<p>When used in the Filecoin ecosystem, the term mining is different from what is prevalent in other blockchains. Usually, miners on a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/proof-of-stake-vs-proof-of-work" rel="noreferrer noopener">Proof-of-Work</a>&nbsp;blockchain will be in charge of verifying transactions and securing the network. On the contrary, miners on the Filecoin network are responsible for storing, providing content, and issuing new blocks. FIlecoin miners will have to provide storage capacity to clients in need of disk space to store their data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There will be multiple types of miners on the Filecoin network, with each performing a specific function. Currently, the ones playing critical roles in the network are the storage miners and retrieval miners. The team also plans to implement repair miners in due course.</p>



<p>Storage miners are the heart of the network. They are responsible for two primary duties, i.e., storing data for clients while earning file coin (FIL) and computing cryptographic proofs to verify storage across time. Unlike other blockchains where earnings depend on hashing power, Filecoin miners receive block rewards and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/network-fees" rel="noreferrer noopener">transaction fees</a>&nbsp;proportional to the storage space they contribute to the network.</p>



<p>The role of the retrieval miners is to provide pipes for fast data retrieval by clients. Retrieval miners on the FIlecoin network receive rewards when they bid and win a particular file in addition to mining fees. They usually secure a deal with prospect clients based on their bandwidth, latency, and how close they are to the client. A retrieval miner will be able to make deals so long as it has enough capacity. The number of deals they can make depends on their maximum bandwidth.</p>



<h3 id="power-and-rewards"><strong>Power and Rewards</strong></h3>



<p>Every miner on the Filecoin network has a power value ascribed to it, and it is proportional to the storage capacity a miner contributes to the network. A better power value increases the chances of a miner being selected to mine a block in every epoch. And for mining blocks, miners earn block rewards and transaction fees for messages included in an underlying block.</p>



<h3 id="how-does-filecoin-work"><strong>How does Filecoin work</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="5334"  height="1855"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/what-is-filecoin.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-34329"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/what-is-filecoin.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/what-is-filecoin.png 1024w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/what-is-filecoin.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/what-is-filecoin.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/what-is-filecoin.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/what-is-filecoin.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/what-is-filecoin.png 380w"  sizes="(max-width: 5334px) 100vw, 5334px" ></figure>



<p>Filecoin works similarly to the IPFS network, allowing users to share and store data with no incentive model. Clients pay miners to store their file, both miner and client reach a deal, and then the miner pledges to store the file and makes it public on the blockchain.</p>



<p>Filecoin then encrypts the data, chop them into chunks, and hosts them on the network. There is a perpetual verification mechanism to check if miners are doing what is expected of them. Filecoin verifies data being stored for the stipulated period using the Proof of Replication (PoRep) and Proof of Spacetime&#8221; (PoST) mechanism. Random miners are chosen to prove random data are still being stored.</p>



<p>In retrieving a file, clients will have to pay retrieval miners to get their request fulfilled.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="why-use-filecoin-storage-network"><strong>Why use Filecoin Storage Network</strong></h3>



<p>A user will opt for a cloud storage provider based on personal preference and factors, including reliability, cost, and speed. On the Filecoin network, users have more bargaining power as they can bargain with any miner. Clients have various parameters such as cost and speed to consider when choosing a miner to store their data. This makes pricing on the network very competitive. Users can continuously verify if their files are being adequately stored by miners they have struck a deal with.</p>



<p>On the side of storage providers, they have a way to monetize their free disk space by making deals, storing data, and in return receive rewards in FIL token. The system has been designed to reward miners proportional to their storage capacity. The more storage you add to the network, the more Filecoin you will earn.</p>



<h3 id="perspectives-and-takeaways"><strong>Perspectives and Takeaways</strong></h3>



<p>Filecoin is widely known for its decentralized cloud storage market and has been working hard, which could be seen on their GitHub page. With a significant increase in miners at various levels, from large-scale data centers to individuals with spare disk space, Filecoin is poised to democratize and decentralize how data is being stored on the web, thanks to its miners.</p>



<p>The launch of its Mainnet onboarded some web 2.0 based applications, which are now functioning as web 3.0 applications. Starling is one of the few projects currently in the development stage and working on using the Filecoin network to store information for long-term preservation. A wide range of applications will utilize the Filecoin network for their cloud storage needs as time goes on. Another example is the Livepeer decentralized video hosting platform that anyone can use to upload and share videos.</p>



<p>Filecoin is also working on using bridges to establish connections with other blockchains. The cross-chain interaction will allow applications on other blockchains to use Filecoin&#8217;s storage as most of these blockchains provide less storage capacity and are also costly. With bridges, Filecoin will bring storage and retrieval support to these platforms. On the other hand, Filecoin will also access some of the features and functionalities of other blockchains.</p>



<p>The last quarter of 2020 saw many projects tap into DeFi and Filecoin was no exception. In November 2020, Anchorage and Tokensoft teamed up to create a wrapped version of the FIL token to be used in popular DeFi applications like Compound, Maker, and Uniswap. This development will open doors for creative DeFi applications and create opportunities for members (Miners and clients) in the Filecoin ecosystem.</p>



<p>In December 2020, it was announced that Fenbushi Capital pledged an investment worth over $15 million to support development in the IPFS and Filecoin ecosystem. Fenbushi was one of the early investors and invested a significant amount in Filecoin&#8217;s public sale in 2017. Since then, it has been actively supporting many Chinese miners to partake in mining on the FIlecoin network by providing them with FIL tokens to stake. Fenbushi&#8217;s collaboration with Filecoin can be viewed as a long term strategic partnership to help the FIlecoin ecosystem with its Ecosystem Fund.</p>

<p><strong>How to store and manage FIL</strong></p>



<p>Because Filecoin launched its Mainnet not long ago, it has just a few wallets that support the native FIL token. It is also possible to store your FIL token on exchange platforms, but it is not recommended because you won&#8217;t have full control of your funds.</p>



<p>We made mention of the wrapped Filecoin (WFIL) earlier in this post. The Wrapped Filecoin is a 1:1 equivalent of Filecoin represented as an ERC-20 on the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/ethereum-wallet" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>&nbsp;network. It is compatible with any ERC-20 wallet. Atomic Wallet is one of the user-friendly wallets you can use to store and manage WFIL. Atomic is a non-custodial&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/cryptocurrency-wallet" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryptocurrency wallet</a>&nbsp;and, as such, grants users access to their private keys. This allows users to recover their wallets quickly.&nbsp;<strong>WalletConnect</strong>&nbsp;is an open-source protocol that enables mobile wallets to connect to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://atomicwallet.io/what-are-dapps" rel="noreferrer noopener">decentralized applications</a>&nbsp;(dApps). Atomic Wallet has this feature embedded and allows users to connect to the most popular DeFi applications seamlessly.</p>
