<p>FTX Token (FTT) is the unit virtual currency used on the FTX ecosystem. It serves as the backbone of the FTX crypto derivatives exchange that offers leveraged trading. Since FTX exchange provides futures trading, FTT can be used as collateral, which increases its utility. FTX token has a total supply of 344,446, 952 FTT with a circulating supply of 95, 375,037 tokens. FTT is available in FTT/USD, FTT/USDT, and FTT/BTC markets. It&#8217;s listed on Binance, Huobi, BitMax, CoinEx, WazirX, and Bitfinex.</p>



<h2 id="brief-history"><br>Brief History</h2>



<p>FTX Token was developed by an all-star team who come from a background of Wall Street firms such as Jane Street and Optiver. The CEO of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, who also started Alameda Research, comes from a background of futures trading and an MIT degree holder in Physics. Others include Gary Wang, who was a software engineer at Google, and Nishad Singh, a former engineer at Facebook. Another notable part of the FTX team is Jen Chan, the company&#8217;s CFO, the former head of Alter Domus&#8217;s office in Hong Kong.</p>



<p>Dan Friedberg, a former partner at Fenwick &amp; West LLP, provides general counsel to the FTX project. The company&#8217;s COO, Constance Wang, has worked at Credit Suisse. FTX takes pride in professionalism and believes that an all-star team can help achieve its mission.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="445"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ftx1-1.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-30632"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ftx1-1.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ftx1-1.png 1024w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ftx1-1.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ftx1-1.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ftx1-1.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ftx1-1.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ftx1-1.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ftx1-1.png 1280w"  sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" ></figure>



<p>FTX has partnered and collaborated with lots of cryptocurrency firms in the industry. Some of the notable partners of FTX Token include; Binance crypto exchange, Circle, Alameda Research, True USD, Paxo, Consensus Labs, Bitfinex, and FBG Capital. One of the fundamental goals of FTX Token is donating to charities around the world. Consequently, employees and affiliates of FTX have donated over $10 million to various charitable causes. They have contributed to Effective Autism, Give Well, The Humane League, and Open AI.</p>



<h2 id="ftx-token-technology-and-benefits"><br>FTX Token Technology and Benefits</h2>



<p>FTX is an innovative derivatives platform that boasts of deep order books, low fees, and tight spreads. In 2018, the platform launched an OTC RFQ system, which allows the exchange to scale its volume to $30 million even in a bear market. FTX&#8217;s world-class portal has an intuitive UI and API whose settlement system is secure and straight forward.</p>



<p>FTX has developed over the last one and a half years to become a leading trader of futures in the market. The FTX team felt that the current futures platforms created a complex environment that made it hard for institutions to trade-in. After lots of work, the team developed the FTX futures platform that has risen to disrupt the market.</p>



<p>Some of the critical features of FTX futures include:</p>



<ul><li>Ability to prevent clawbacks – The current futures systems have a reduced risk management system that results in millions of losses through clawbacks. FTX&#8217;s 3-tiered liquidation model helps reduce the occurrence of clawbacks. To start with, FTX closes down positions with rate-limited liquidation orders. The platform has a unique liquidity program that intervenes to provide to accounts that face bankruptcy. The platform also leverages an insurance fund that helps prevent losses.</li><li>Centralized collateral pool – Unlike other futures exchanges, FTX posts collateral in multiple accounts and tokens. The same system is used to mature traditional futures today, allowing traders to post collateral in a single currency. The system also allows universal stablecoin settlement, enabling traders to use stable coins as collateral for all derivative products. By using stablecoins, traders get a USD-based price exposure without having a bank account. At the moment, the only two stablecoins fit for this feature are USDC and TUSD.</li><li>Non-inverted futures – Usually, in the futures market, when a pair is stated as BTC/USD, it often means USD/BTC. However, for FTX, the futures aren&#8217;t inverted, which means a user&#8217;s USD PnL is one&#8217;s actual number of BTC contracts. The order book indicates the number of BTC contracts that a person owns.</li><li>Leveraged tokens – These ERC-20 compliant tokens are a genius product by FTX and put it on the crypto space map. Most spot exchanges don&#8217;t have a way to short or have a leveraged position. However, the FTX leveraged token system lets traders take a short position without trading on a margin. The platform offers 3x, -1x, or -3x leveraged tokens for BTC, ETHC, XRP, EOS, USDT, BNB, TRX, LEO, and BCH.</li><li>OTC portal – Thanks to Alameda Research, the platform has embedded an OTC portal that lets traders transact at the click of a button. The portal gives traders access to Alameda&#8217;s deep liquidity pool at no fees.</li></ul>



<p>Due to the above features, the FTX Token is backed by a platform with a robust architecture that is hard to replicate. The platform is backed by Alameda research, which is the most extensive liquidity provider in the secondary markets. This implies:</p>



<ul><li>Live product – The FTX Token is already live and functioning. Most projects are still issuing a token raise with promises of future returns.</li><li>Liquidity – At the moment, only BitMEX BTC perpetual futures are more liquid than FTX. Due to the backing by Alameda Research, traders are trading upwards of $30 million worth of transactions daily. For an exchange that&#8217;s barely three years old in the market, that&#8217;s an impressive record.</li><li>Domain expertise – Designers of FTX are people who have worked in top positions in the industry and have employed this experience in product development. The team fully understands the futures markets, especially things to do with collateral, maintenance margin, and the liquidation process. FTX relies heavily on Alameda Research that has spent thousands of hours studying the market and understanding every aspect.</li><li>New product development – FTX was the first to offer USDT futures. The product put FTX on the map since many institutions were looking for a way to leverage USDT but were hesitant due to Tether&#8217;s volatility. There&#8217;s also the Leveraged Token brought to the market by FTX. The sector is unexplored, and FTX has provided traders with a huge opportunity to implement it. The unique stablecoin settlement product offered by FTX is a trailblazer, and most futures exchanges are already adopting the innovative design.</li><li>Strong credibility – Due to its connection to Alameda, FTX has a strong network and reputation. Alameda has a stable relationship with leading exchanges such as Binance, Huobi, and OKEx. The platform&#8217;s credibility has attracted offers from various exchanges and crypto platforms.</li><li>Fast development – Developing large futures products takes time due to the complexity of products. However, FTX can leverage on the Alameda team, which are used to building complex cryptosystems under pressure. That way, the platform can provide excellent features in a day. The unique backing of Alameda Research gives FTX a substantial head start in the crypto space, which is hard to replicate.</li></ul>



<h2 id="how-does-ftx-token-work"><br>How does FTX Token work?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="445"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ftx3-1.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-30643"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ftx3-1.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ftx3-1.png 1024w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ftx3-1.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ftx3-1.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ftx3-1.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ftx3-1.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ftx3-1.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ftx3-1.png 1280w"  sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" ></figure>



<p>FTX leveraged tokens are ERC-20 tokens provided on the Ethereum blockchain. The product was first developed by FTX, allowing traders to engage in cryptocurrencies without managing their leverage position. Usually, when getting into a leveraged position with a cryptocurrency, you have to worry about liquidation, margins, collateral, and funding rates. However, FTX leveraged tokens have taken care of these hustles making the product unique and attractive.</p>



<p>Since the leveraged products are on a public blockchain, they function similarly to other tokens. Therefore, you can store, trade, or transfer like other ERC-20 compliant tokens. However, the leveraged tokens may lose value in a zig-zag market and are meant for short term trading.</p>



<p>FTX leveraged token exposes the trader to leveraged positions. The token is issued on FTX exchange but can be traded on other exchanges. The tokens are easily bought and sold like other ERC-20 tokens. While these tokens&#8217; creation and development make sense for advanced traders, the process is attractive and exciting.</p>



<p>FTX is keen on increasing the FTX token utility, which is the backbone of the FTX derivatives exchange. The platform has offered incentives to increase the demand for FTT while reducing its circulating supply. FTX has done the following to increase the utility of FTT;</p>



<ul><li>Token burn – The platform will repurchase and burn FTT tokens equivalent to 33% of the fees generated on the FTX markets, 10% of the net additions to the insurance fund, and 5% of the funds raised from other uses on the platform. FTX has a schedule that involves the burning of FTT every week. At the moment, the schedule starts at 10 pm HKT on Monday and ends at 11.59 pm HKT on Tuesday.</li><li>Collateral – The unique thing about FTT is that it can be used as collateral for futures positions. FTX plans to allow FTT as collateral for margin trading in the future. Doing so increases the utility and demand for FTT.</li><li>Discounts – Customers who hold FTT for a long time will get to enjoy lower fees on the FTX futures market.</li><li>OTC rebates – Those that hold FTT will receive rebates on their OTC trading on FTX. This has increased the demand for FTT.</li><li>Socialized gains – Since FTX doesn&#8217;t suffer from clawbacks faced by other exchanges in the market, it has managed to increase its insurance fund. Its unique backstop liquidity provided by Alameda allows FTX to handle overdue accounts, which put it a spot ahead of the rest.</li><li>White label solutions – FTX has received offers by crypto institutions that want to purchase the platform&#8217;s white label version of the OTC portal. The purchases can be made using the FTT token, which increases its utility.</li><li>Future growth – FTX is committed to providing revolutionary products to the crypto market, and there&#8217;s no limit to what the platform can achieve. For example, the platform may launch a spot exchange where FTT will be used for the Initial Coin Offering.</li></ul>



<p>Unlocking of the FTT token has been a significant part of the project. So far, locked tokens have been released in three rounds started on 29th July 2019, where 50,000,00 FTT were sold in round one, 6,500,000 were sold in round two, and 2,800,000 were sold in round three. The company tokens have been unlocked for three years, and selling will end on 1st May 2022.</p>



<p>FTX has a commendable revenue model and is always looking for creative ways to add to their revenue. One source of their income is through exchange fees where the maker and taker fees are two bps and seven bps, respectively. The daily management fees for leveraged tokens are three bps, while the creation fees are ten bps. Other ways that FTX generates fees are through options, spot exchange fees, and margin trading. The fast-growing FTX OTC portal also makes tens of millions of dollars each day.</p>



<h2 id="perspectives-and-takeaway"><br>Perspectives and Takeaway</h2>



<p>More than just a crypto derivatives exchange.</p>



<p>Over the short period that FTX has been on the crypto space, it has set a pace that other exchanges are finding hard to follow. Its unique and innovative products have left many amazed at the potential that the secondary markets hold. The team at FTX is on a mission to provide customers and other stakeholders with never-seen derivatives products, leveraged tokens, options, and volatility products. Their robust and initiative platform is user friendly and makes it easy for first-time users to enjoy futures trading.</p>



<p>At the moment, FTX supports over 115 cryptocurrencies on the platform with more coming up. In less than a year, FTX has launched eight innovative futures products making the platform a sought after leader in the derivatives market. In May 2020, FTX launched a BTC hash rate futures tool that allowed Bitcoin miners to leverage against mining difficult. The robust architecture of the product showed that FTX was committed and could cater to different people&#8217;s unique demands in the crypto space.</p>



<p>Recently FTX introduced MOVE contracts on its platform, representing the absolute value that a contract moves in a given period. With three types of MOVE contracts, daily, weekly, and quarterly, FTX has shown that it&#8217;s determined to ensure traders&#8217; endless opportunities. Its onboarding process that takes about 5 minutes has also made it attractive to investors and other market players.</p>



<p>Leading US exchange announced custodial services for FTT, terming it the &#8216;largest exchange to date.&#8217; Through a spot exchange, its launch in the United States has done wonders for the FTX brand, which registered as a money service provider to comply with the country&#8217;s regulations. Last year in December, Binance announced a strategic crypto investment of an undisclosed amount in FTX, which is designed to add value to the crypto ecosystem.</p>



<p>FTX has given crypto traders in the market lots of features that cater to high volumes. The firm has reached out to significant crypto providers who have responded positively, and FTX believes that they can hit a daily trading volume of $ 50 million. FTX believes that it can offer $10 million daily trading volume through their unique leveraged token product. FTX is also always reaching out to crypto platforms to onboard them on their innovative OTC portal. Through new clients, FTX hopes to add another $25 million to its daily trading volume. Ultimately, FTX believes that a daily trading volume of $5 billion is a possibility.</p>



<p>The future looks bright for FTX as it continues to position itself on the secondary crypto markets space through strategic partnerships and innovative products. The platform thrives well despite the positive competition, which ensures that the market has nothing but quality products. Through referrals, FTX has quickly expanded its OTC portal, which offers some of the industry&#8217;s tightest spreads. FTX is targeting large crypto institutions and is always working to ensure traders and investors work with cryptocurrency products in the most efficient manner possible.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0x-guide-1920x1080-1-1920x1080.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-30524" ></figure>



<p>With cryptocurrency becoming more popular and people jumping on the bandwagon daily, it is crucial to understand all the moving parts that go with this economic revolution. To get involved in cryptocurrency, you have to go through a centralized cryptocurrency exchange. Because of the horror stories surrounding centralized exchanges, many people shy away.</p>



<p>Enter the 0x Project. This decentralized exchange “is an open, permissionless protocol allowing for ERC20 tokens to be traded on the Ethereum blockchain.” When version two of 0x is released, it is expected to support more tokens than just ERC20.</p>



<p>Read on to learn more about 0x and how this protocol platform works.</p>



<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-0x"><br>A Brief History of 0x</h2>



<p>In 2016, co-founders Will Warren and Amir Baneali created 0x. They wanted to create a world where assets, stocks, precious metals, currencies, and any other kind of asset could be traded as tokens on a blockchain platform. The entire project was backed by companies such as Jen Advisors, Fintech Blockchain Group, Pantera Capital, and more.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="445"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0x1.png"  alt=""  class="wp-image-30535"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0x1.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0x1.png 1024w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0x1.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0x1.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0x1.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0x1.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0x1.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0x1.png 1280w"  sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" ></figure>



<h2 id="0x-technology-and-advantages"><br>0x Technology and Advantages</h2>



<p>Running on the Ethereum blockchain, 0x is the engine that has been powering popular DeFi exchanges such as Paradex, Bamboo Relay, and Radar Relay and giving them the means to pool their liquidity. 0x offers users open-source tools, such as 0x Launch Kit, Asset Swapper, and 0X instant to make trading digital assets easy.</p>



<p>The newest version, which went live August 10, 2020, is helping create a more cohesive DeFi system by adding a new set of bridge contracts. These contracts help aggregate liquidity over several DeFi exchange networks. This new version also allows for staking to the 0x protocol and provides market makers incentives to do so by rewarding them with Ethereum currency and additional governance voting power. A new live interface that is coming soon will allow users to stake their tokens with the market maker of their choice.</p>



<p>Basically, the 0x protocol is what is called a blockchain layer. It is supposed to make it easy to tokenize and asset, product, or commodity while also adding networked liquidity to it. It can be used with stablecoins so they can be collateral for loans or with predication markets, where users can purchase futures that have been pegged to an event outcome or transaction.</p>



<p>0x also has a vast potential market in order books for digital assets, such as apps or even online gaming, where permanent records of gameplay are needed. These records could be provided to users in a non-fungible token – or NFT – that is tamper-resistant. It could even use an NFT for users who need to keep track of things like collectibles, stocks, bonds, loyalty points for retail operations, and even banking transactions. NFTs are also good options with 0x for generating permanent legal documents that live on the blockchain.</p>



<h2 id="how-does-0x-work"><br>How Does 0x Work?</h2>



<p>0x is unlike other decentralized exchanges because it is cheap to use, very accessible, and fast. It uses an off-chain ordering relay to save on “gas” – the cost to make the transaction – during trades. It is also built on the Ethereum blockchain, which is the core of many smart contract-based exchanges that have been decentralized. Using smart contracts, users have full control over their assets, something a centralized exchange does not provide.</p>



<p>One of the problems of a decentralized exchange 0x tries to resolve is the blockchain transaction cost. Every time a trader wants to deposit their cryptocurrency into a smart contract, they have to execute a blockchain transaction, which is then processed by “miners” who collect a fee for their services. Every transaction has a fee associated with it, and when users make multiple transactions, the fees add up. Plus, the time to process the transaction can vary.</p>



<p>Using off-chain ordering relays, 0x can lessen the fees charged to the user by “miners.” The protocol is for the transaction to be filled by another user. This saves the blockchain for value transfers and other on-chain settlements while other commands are being filled on the side. This reduces the amount of “gas fees” charged.</p>



<p>The 0x protocol users relayers, makers and takers to process orders through the blockchain. The relayers are in charge of broadcasting orders, using private or public order books. They host the order books but are unable to execute the actual trade. Relayers are the go-between for the makers who start the transaction and the network. The order is picked up by takers who submit the request to their smart contract and fulfilling the order. When the transaction is complete, the relayer is paid their fee in ZRX, the native token of 0x.</p>



<p>The ZRX token can then be used as internal currency for the network because it is also an Ethereum token, it is also used for governance over the 0x upgrade system, giving the holder a say in how 0x can be improved and evolved. How much say a user gets depends on how much ZRZ they hold. Token holders also receive protocol liquidity rewards in ETH tokens.</p>



<h2 id="perspectives-and-takeaways"><br>Perspectives and Takeaways</h2>



<p>Unlike the Ether Delta platform that 0x is similar to, 0x does not have a downtime issue when it is being upgraded. This means users of the system will still have access to their transactions even when an upgrade is happening. 0x will use their native ZRX coins to ensure a secure upgrade. As critical governance is important to 0x, the system is set up as a pipeline of smart contracts. Each segment of the pipeline can be removed and upgraded while the system continues to work. Once the segment is upgraded, it is replaced, and the next one is removed, upgraded, replaced, and so on.</p>



<p>0x has also created a governance system that uses its ZRX tokens for voting and has solid mechanics that dictate how it is governed. To make sure all 0x stakeholders are represented equally and fairly, the governance system has three main phases.</p>



<p>The first phase, the community managed token registry, is an official on-chain reference for verifying token addresses and exchange rates. Users can reference this registry before they make a transaction for verification purposed. At the moment, the 0x core team is managing it, but it will be converted to a community-managed system.</p>



<p>The second phase is the community veto power. To ensure the governance system is working correctly and wholly vetted, the core team will test the system by proposing upgrades the community can review. ZRX token holders have the power to veto the upgrades, thereby controlling the 0x platform.</p>



<p>The third phase, liquid democracy, lets ZRX token holders vote directly on policies governing the protocol and also allows them to delegate their vote to another delegate who can vote for them. The second delegate can also choose their own delegate, and so on. Anyone who doesn’t like the way their delegate voted can take back the delegate’s vote and register their own. The ability to go from direct democracy to representative democracy and back again is liquid democracy.</p>

<h2 id="views-on-0x"><br>Views on 0x</h2>



<p>“Early adoption metrics and [decentralized exchanges] using the ZRX protocol suggest a bright future. DEXs will continue to be developed and deployed during 2018 and beyond, fulfilling the need to decrease the custodial risk inherent in centralized exchanges.” &#8211; Josh Olszewicz, Trader at Techemy Capital Ltd.</p>



<p>“We are big fans of 0x. As the number of tokens becomes infinite, you need a protocol, not just a central exchange, to find counterparties. Just like you needed a search engine, not just a directory, to find websites as the number became infinite.” &#8211; David Sacks, Co-Founder of Craft Ventures</p>



<p>“0x is emerging as the leading [decentralized exchange] platform within the Ethereum ecosystem. Not only is the core protocol well-designed and fully functional, but 0x has also incentivized a whole ecosystem of third-party relayers whose services will make using 0x even easier than using a centralized exchange.” &#8211; Myles Snider, Research Associate at Multicoin Capital</p>

<p>ZRX tokens can be obtained by becoming a relayer or issued to partnering dApps and future end-users. ZRX tokens can also be bought, sold, or exchanged for other cryptocurrencies on many centralized and decentralized exchanges. The tokens are considered assets, and they are currently valued at a little over $0.2 USD.</p>



<p>Since ZRX is considered an ERC20 token and abides by the rules and standards of the Ethereum network, your storage solution should be highly secure and one that does not store its private keys in an online fashion. Mobile and desktop wallets are good options, while a hardware wallet will give you the highest protection level but are susceptible to hardware and firmware errors or can be easily misplaced.</p>



<p>Atomic Wallet currently supports 0x. The wallet provides you with the security you need while managing and exchanging your ZRX tokens. Using a mnemonic seed to generate your private keys, Atomic Wallet gives you total control over your cryptocurrency. Your keys never leave your device. Atomic Wallet provides you with an all-in-one solution to manage ZRX and 300+ other cryptocurrencies along with the top ones.</p>



<p>Additionally, the 0x protocol allows users to make a wallet to wallet trading without using a centralized exchange. dApps are starting to use wallet to wallet in their projects. It allows them to have fast, low-cost operations without the need to sacrifice security or personal management of assets. Additionally, since it is built on the Ethereum blockchain, it uses smart contracts to help secure the protocol. 0x is a complementary solution to exchange platforms.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion"><br>Conclusion</h2>



<p>0x protocol has a good chance of being the future of cryptocurrency exchanges, if not the premier exchange. It provides immense flexibility and is consistently evolving. Version two will be released soon, and it will provide support for all token standards beyond just ERC20 tokens. When version two is released, users will be able to trade, say, a CryptoKitty for a ZRX token.</p>



<p>Version two will also make it easier for users to write their own smart contracts externally and then applying them to the 0x platform. It will be able to support the Trezor hardware wallet and will less susceptible to scams thanks to the implementation of the EIP 712. It will also allow multiple orders to be batched together.</p>



<p>Some of the features and benefits of 0x include:</p>



<ul><li>Network liquidity allowing users to tap a shared pool of assets</li><li>Flexible integration as it is a modular system and allows the addition of exchange functionality</li><li>Robust smart contracts that have been vetted through two rounds of intense security audits</li><li>An extensible API that lets users plug in their own smart contracts</li><li>Off-chain order relays with the on-chain settlement that reduces blockchain bloat and provides gas efficiency.</li></ul>

<p>Decentralized Finance has been gaining traction for the last few years, and for a good reason. It gives financial access to people who would not get the benefits of the central banking system. With decentralized finance, anyone can borrow and lend in crypto without needing the requirements that come with the legacy banking system such as KYC. As DeFi grows in acceptance, the number of protocols serving the space has grown with platforms like MakerDAO now becoming more visible in crypto space. One of the platforms that have taken the DeFi space by storm is&nbsp;Aave (LEND).</p>



<h2 id="what-is-aave"><br>What is Aave?</h2>



<p>Aave is a protocol that allows people to create their own money markets in a decentralized environment. Aave launched its main net in 2017 at a time when most people did not even have an idea of what DeFi is all about. Simply put, Aave is a platform where people can borrow by agreeing on repayment terms with lenders, without involving a third party. The native token on the Aave ecosystem is dubbed LEND. At the moment, Aave (LEND) has a circulating supply of 1,299, 999,942, and a total supply of the same amount.</p>



<h2 id="brief-history"><br>Brief History</h2>



<p>Aave was launched in 2017 by Stani Kulechov. The project started with the ETHLend ICO that&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/aave/ethlend-token-sale-event-successfully-closes-with-16-2-million-usd-raised-d0e0a1206141" rel="noreferrer noopener">raised $16.2 million</a>&nbsp;on November 30, 2017. For the token sale, ETHLend partnered with Eidoo and worked with more than 5000 applicants for the token sale following a strict KYC policy. After a successful ICO, the project was&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/aave/ethlend-reveals-a-new-parent-brand-aave-launching-multiple-products-e94362a5204e" rel="noreferrer noopener">rebranded to Aave</a>&nbsp;in 2018. The goal was to integrate its platform with traditional technology offerings and grow further. Even after the rebrand, the team remained the same and was headed by Stani. Some of the other key players are:</p>



<ul><li>Jordan – Chief Operating Officer</li><li>Rowan – Creative director</li><li>Alexandra – Risk manager</li><li>Emilio – Software engineer</li><li>Ernesto – Software engineer</li><li>Andrey – Software engineer</li><li>Villle – Chief compliance officer</li></ul>



<p>Finally, on January 8, 2020, the Aave protocol officially went live on the Ethereum mainnet with some innovative features such as;</p>



<ul><li><em>Flash loans</em>,&nbsp;one of the most important features of Aave protocol, which enable users to borrow instantly without the need for collateral.</li></ul>



<ul><li><em>Aave interest bearing tokens (aTokens)</em>,&nbsp;an innovative tokenization model that are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed. As mentioned on Aave&#8217;s website, &#8220;The aTokens are pegged 1:1 to the value of the underlying asset that is deposited in Aave protocol. ATokens, such as aDai, can be freely stored, transferred, and traded&#8221;. Most importantly, the tokens collect interest in real-time that you can notice your wallet balance is increasing continuously.</li></ul>



<ul><li><em>Stable rate model</em><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;works as a fixed-rate loan that protects borrowers from the volatility of variable interest rates.</li></ul>



<ul><li><em>Rate switching</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>allows users to switch between stable and variable rates, which helps to get the best interest rates.</li></ul>



<ul><li><em>Perpetual loans&nbsp;</em>enable users to get liquidity from their deposits without any repayment schedule. This could be possible by the over-collateralization of all loans, which is the primary goal of decentralized finance.</li></ul>

<h2 id="how-does-aave-work"><br>How does Aave work?</h2>



<p>The working mechanism of Aave is pretty simple. You need to offer collateral that is larger (over collateralized) than the amount that you are borrowing. For context, when you want to borrow, you have to deposit coins in a pool. The pool then decides amongst itself, how much of the money in its possession it wants to lend out. The rest of the money is put in a reserve. The goal of the reserve is to protect lenders from the volatility that characterizes the crypto market. It also gives lenders the leeway to withdraw their money at any time. Once you deposit money into a pool, you can then go ahead and borrow an amount lower than the amount you have raised as collateral. If you are unable to repay the loan in the stipulated time, you automatically lose the amount you had raised as collateral. Similarly, if the dollar value of the amount raised as collateral falls below the required collateral level, they are also automatically liquidated. To collect data on prices about the assets offered as collateral on the platform, Aave employs&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/aave/the-aave-oracle-network-powered-by-chainlink-is-now-live-45bb8a5a8c4e" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chainlink (LINK) oracles</a>. The number of assets that one can borrow and lend on Aave is quite diverse. Some of them are as below:</p>



<ol><li>Dai (DAI)</li><li>True USD (TUSD)</li><li>Tether (USDT)</li><li>Synthetix USD (SUSD)</li><li>Binance USD (BUSD)</li><li>Ethereum (ETH)</li><li>ETHLend (LEND)</li><li>Basic Attention Token (BAT)</li><li>Enjin (ENJ)</li><li>Ren (REN)</li><li>Kyber Network (KNC)</li><li>Chainlink (LINK)</li><li>Decentraland (MANA)</li><li>Maker (MKR)</li><li>Augur (REP)</li><li>Synthetix Network Token (SNX)</li><li>Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)</li><li>0x (ZRX)</li></ol>



<p>You are probably wondering how interest rates are decided, right? Well, just like in traditional banking, there are two types of interest rates on Aave, namely: Stable (Fixed) and Variable. The borrower has the option of choosing between the two. The stable rate is calculated as the average of interest rates in 30 days. On the other hand, the variable rate is determined by an algorithm based on the usage of funds in a pool. Usually, the higher the utilization of a pool, the higher the interest rates.</p>



<p>It is important to note that the Aave token is the native token to the Aave ecosystem. When one deposits coins with the goal of lending or borrowing, they are automatically converted into Aave tokens. The tokens are then added to the user&#8217;s Ethereum wallet and can be converted to the underlying asset. The Aave token (LEND) is also used to pay fees on the Aave protocol and is then burned. The protocol also intends to use the token for governance, which means that token holders can use them to vote on the direction the project takes in the future.</p>



<p>Another aspect of Aave that users need to understand is the concept of flash loans. This entails getting a loan without raising any collateral. For a flash loan to work, the crypto that is borrowed has to be repaid by the time the next Ethereum block is mined. Failure to repay means that all transactions that happened between the time of borrowing and the block mining are canceled. These loans are given for incredibly short periods and are mostly used by arbitrage traders.</p>



<h2 id="aave-technology-and-advantages"><br>Aave Technology and Advantages</h2>



<p>Aave technology that allows people to create lending markets has several advantages as below:&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="it-enables-cross-border-lending-nbsp"><br>It enables cross-border lending&nbsp;</h3>



<p>With the traditional banking system, individuals can only borrow money within their home countries. This is due to the risks involved in cross-border lending and differing government regulations. The problem is that this denies millions of people access to crucial funding for their various business endeavors. With Aave, anyone from anywhere in the world can borrow in a free market environment provided they can raise the necessary collateral. Once this gains traction worldwide, it could open a global business in ways that the centralized banking system can never do.</p>



<h3 id="it-does-not-need-a-bank-nbsp"><br>It does not need a bank&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Most people take the idea of having a bank account for granted. Unfortunately, this is the luxury that a lot of people do not have. Research shows that up to 2 billion people do not have a bank account. This means that those 2 billion people do not have access to loans that can help them change their lives. With Aave, one does not need a bank account to get financial services. As such, even the most remote societies that are unbanked have an opportunity to compete effectively with people who have access to the traditional banking system.</p>



<h3 id="it-8217-s-an-investment-opportunity"><br>It&#8217;s an investment opportunity</h3>



<p>The crypto market is still young, and prices are likely to stay volatile for a while. Crypto projects like Aave offer investors an option to make money as they await the markets to stabilize. That&#8217;s because investors can earn money by charging interest when lending crypto. Since the DeFi space is not yet fully developed, and competition is low, the interest rates can be quite high. This makes lending a good hedge for crypto volatility.</p>



<h3 id="aave-eliminates-the-need-for-credit-ratings"><br>Aave eliminates the need for credit ratings</h3>



<p>In the legacy banking system, a person&#8217;s ability to get their credit ratings to determine a loan—the better the credit rating, the better the chances of accessing a loan. Unfortunately, there are times when one falls into a bad credit rating due to unavoidable circumstances such as the current coronavirus pandemic. Aave eliminates this problem because there is no credit rating required. So long as one can raise the necessary crypto collateral, you can access a loan on the Aave DeFi protocol.</p>



<h3 id="it-is-fast-nbsp"><br>It is fast&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Anyone who has ever tried to take a bank loan knows that it is a tedious process. You have to do a lot of paperwork; the bank will then review that for them to establish whether you are creditworthy or not. These are issues that one does not have to deal with when using Aave. With Aave, there are no central organizations involved, which means there is no paperwork. So one gets a loan fast no matter where the person is on the planet. Such efficiency is necessary, especially when one needs money for emergency reasons. They do not have the time to go through the lengthy and tedious processes of the traditional bank.</p>



<h2 id="perspectives-and-takeaways"><br>Perspectives and Takeaways</h2>



<p>Aave, like other DeFi protocols, is changing finance. Opening up lending even to the unbanked will drive up financial inclusion in ways never seen before.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="445"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aave3.png"  alt="pic 3"  class="wp-image-30294"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aave3.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aave3.png 1024w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aave3.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aave3.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aave3.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aave3.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aave3.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aave3.png 1280w"  sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" ></figure>



<p>What&#8217;s even more impressive is how positive the crypto community is towards the technology. On July 13, 2020, Coindesk reported that Aave had started a new feature called credit delegation. With the new feature, Aave users will be in a position to set up credit lines that can be used for peer-to-peer lending. Using the new feature, an investor in Aave can deposit stable coins, and instead of using them as collateral, give the right to borrow to someone else. The investor delegating the role to borrow can then earn more interest since they are bearing higher risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new feature attracted praise from multiple quarters, including Su Zhu, the CEO of Three Arrows Capital, a Singapore-based digital assets fund. Zhu said that,&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Aave&#8217;s introduction of credit delegation is groundbreaking.&#8221;</p>



<p>Such recognition goes to show that not only is DeFi going mainstream and getting accepted internationally, Aave as a DeFi project is gaining traction too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Aave team is cognizant of this fact and has been working to improve the project continually and meet the growing demand. Commenting on the addition of the new credit delegation feature,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.coindesk.com/first-mover-aave-lend-token-defi-hype" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aave CEO</a>&nbsp;stated that,</p>



<p>&#8220;Most of the traction comes due to our wide asset selection that you can use as collateral and the ability to borrow flash loans without collateral, which has become a popular tool.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an earlier&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1280500978266132493?utm_source=newsletters&amp;utm_medium=firstmover&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;clid=00Q1I00000KJy0CUAT" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweet</a>, he acknowledged the growing DeFi space and highlighted the steps the project was taking to grow He said,</p>



<p>&#8220;Credit Delegation allows @AaveAave to scale DeFi TVL into financial debt markets worldwide, making DeFi the liquidity backbone of finance. The overall DeFi narrative expands from deposit capital; to DeFi to source capital from DeFi. As a lawyer, my passion in the space has been always to bring Smart Contracts and Law together to help end-user consumers. First, we brought earnings back to consumers, and now we are bringing the alternative liquidity for consumers by injecting DeFi liquidity into the debt markets.&#8221;</p>



<p>The above tweet hints at the direction that Aave is taking. The project is looking to become a bona fide alternative to finance 1.0, which operates outside of the control of centralized banking systems.</p>



<p>In essence, as crypto space grows in acceptance, the depth of Aave will grow as well. It is a validation of this project, as a serious player in crypto space, one with a good chance of long-term growth.</p>

<p>Republic Protocol – or REN – is a cryptocurrency project focused on changing the digital currency sector, starting by simplifying value exchange over a vast array of blockchains. It has been built to help with cross-chain liquidity, providing users with better privacy and to be used with the financial markets. This project has gained a lot of interest as it is trying to build a decentralized dark pool of cross-chain cryptocurrency trading. Here we will discuss everything you need to know about REN and how this cryptocurrency can work for you.</p>



<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-ren-nbsp"><br>A Brief History Of Ren&nbsp;</h2>



<p>REN, founded in late 2017, will allow traders to start placing orders in a secure and completely private manner using their open-source dark pool protocol. Ethereum, ERC20, and Bitcoin will be available in this pool. It will use multi-party computations to develop a matching engine to cross orders on the decentralized order book for users.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="445"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ren1.png"  alt="pic 2"  class="wp-image-30235"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ren1.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ren1.png 1024w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ren1.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ren1.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ren1.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ren1.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ren1.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ren1.png 1280w"  sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" ></figure>



<p>A dark pool, which REN functions on, is basically an Over-The-Counter (OTC) marketplace for institutional investors to anonymously execute large block orders of cryptocurrency. The dark pool keeps the exchange out of the general public, which is why they are anonymous. The dark pools are mostly operated by investment banks and other market movers and shakers, allowing them to get large block orders at fair and reasonable prices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In late 2018, the Republic Protocol had its beta mainnet launch. It made sure a wave that REN climbed into the top 100 tokens for the next few months after the beta launch. It was clear that there was an interest in both the technological model REN was built on and the business model. Both were delivering limitless value transfers across as many blockchains as it could. It also offered zero knowledge-based transfers of the REN token. It is hoped that once REN is fully implemented, it will serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency sector.</p>



<p>Prior to the beta launch, there was an initial coin offering for REN, and it raised $34 million. Founder Taiyang Zhang and Loong Wang founded the project in Australia. The country opted to join forces with them to create the Republic Protocol. This ultimate crypto-based trading platform offered levels of privacy and shared liquidity that had not been seen in the cryptocurrency sector before.</p>



<h2 id="ren-technology-and-advantages"><br>Ren Technology And Advantages</h2>



<p>As REN continues to grow and add general applications in the future, it’s the main focus at the moment is supporting private and decentralized finance. It has three main architectural components that make up most of the underlying design, divided into layers. The first layer is the zero-knowledge transaction layer. This layer provides the user a place for storing and transferring REN tokens without revealing the amount of the transaction or how much the user has in their cryptocurrency wallet.</p>



<p>The second layer, the interoperability layer, handles all of the trustless swaps on the blockchains. It acts as a bridge between the tokens that are featured on the blockchain. The last layer, the dark pool, has secret order matching engines that process orders only the owners know of. Using Darknodes, REN checks orders with Darknodes against the distributed hidden order book. This allows the orders to be opened without revealing the price of the order or the volume. Only the exchange itself knows this information. When paired with the other two layers, transactions are done in full privacy.</p>



<p>REN runs on Ren Virtual Machine – or RenVM – which is similar to a blockchain. It is replicated over many physical machines that are secured to the VM by running on Darknodes. In exchange for fees, these machines help with computing and disk storage resources. Anything executed on RenVM is hidden from Darknodes to protect user’s privacy.</p>



<p>RenVM also has a dedicated software development kit (SDK) that is a plug-in for DeFi applications. The SDK is an open-source technology that helps the existing financial systems by removing the financial burden from it caused by intermediary applications. The decentralized layer allows RenVM to be integrated with applications or smart contracts on the blockchain. RenVM was built to help support privacy and interoperability features.</p>



<h2 id="perspectives-and-takeaways"><br>Perspectives And Takeaways</h2>



<p>Touted as an all-around cryptocurrency solution, REN has been leaning heavily towards financial applications. The REN Virtual Machine (RenVM) has been at the forefront of the Republic Protocol’s marketing effort because of what it can provide. REN promises easy access to inter-chain liquidity by developing the RenVM for use with decentralized applications (DApps). Existing DApps should be more customizable so that business applications that need decentralization and trustless environments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This also allows tokens from any supported blockchain to be available for existing smart contracts with the REN eliminating any need to wrap or unwrap them. This means that cryptocurrencies can be integrated into existing decentralized exchanges and liquidity pools. REN’s ecosystem can also support the development and deployment of general-purpose applications using the “zero-knowledge proof” system mentioned above.</p>



<p>The big push behind Republic Protocol is their insistence on user’s privacy. The platform wants users to be able to work in the applications, states and inputs that remain secret to others on the network. This will help REN support confidential lending, collateralization, and exchanges in the financial world. It is hoped that REN will be able to provide the privacy protection needed to run more advanced financial transactions on blockchains thanks to the full sovereignty of their data.</p>



<p>This goes hand-in-hand with REN’s focus on interoperability and communication between different blockchain ecosystems. As they call it, this interoperable liquidity would allow Ethereum to support ZCash with help from REN, as an example, without compromising ZCash’s privacy protocols. REN also uses secret scripts to respond to events on different blockchains. This supports the ability to perform a transaction without revealing the user’s input, output states.</p>



<p>Finally, a trusted intermediary is not needed when operating on a REN dark pool. Dark pools – exchanges or private financial platforms – allow for trading securities based on how they are placed and executed on hidden order books. This is especially appealing to investors who wish for full anonymity during an operation. REN provides for cross-chain trading of various tokens, and the introduction of the REN token provides additional incentive to engage in trading.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion"><br>Conclusion</h2>



<p>As of June 2020, RenVM was released to mainnet after extensive designing, testing, and auditing. CTO Loong Wang claims that “This is, by far, the greatest achievement of the REN project to date. With it, begins a new era of cross-chain interoperability, where we can finally begin breaking down the silos between chains.” So far, REN has seen no down-time, no mint failures, and no burn failures.</p>



<p>The company is now looking towards open sourcing some of their algorithms, both technical and non-technical. This makes it easier to iterate, test and understand how they will work when added into the platform. There have been more optimizations to REN as well as work on the codebase to give users a simpler, safer, easier, and faster system. The development team has also started working on expanding and standardizing the interface to support more chains in preparation for cross-chain transactions on new chains, starting with Substrate.</p>



<p>Republic Protocol is making great strides towards helping financial institutions and other investors make the cryptocurrency exchanges they need. REN will support multiple blockchains, allowing smart contracts and other user transactions to remain anonymous and safe. It will be adding additional general applications to the platform, providing users with a more robust private decentralized finance platform.</p>



<p>The RenVM engine that supports the platform is currently the only interoperability solution in the cryptocurrency sector that can scale and “allow for secret computation over multiple input methods and by multiple parties. This network and its SDKs enable developers to provide DeFi applications with cross-chain functionality. It serves as a bridge between the blockchains and the traditional financial world. It gives even the first-time user the ability to experience seamless and decentralized interoperability the first time they use the platform. Any DeFi application can use RenVMs capabilities and applications with their existing smart contracts.</p>

<p>MakerDAO is a decentralized organization built on the Ethereum blockchain. It&#8217;s designed to allow people to borrow and lend in crypto, in processes that are executed using smart contracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You are probably wondering how this happens yet cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, right? Well, the MakerDAO ecosystem uses a stable coin called DAI in pricing lending rates and amounts repayable. The MakerDAO ecosystem also has another token called MKR (More on this later).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, we will focus on the history of MakerDAO, how it works, and its advantages to the crypto ecosystem, especially in decentralized finance (DeFi).&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="brief-history-nbsp"><br>Brief History<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>MakerDAO was founded by Rune Christensen in 2014 and has its headquarters in Santa Cruz, California. In 2018, MakerDAO received a capital boost of $15 million from Andreessen Horowitz. He bought 6% of the total Maker (MKR) in circulation. At this point, MakerDAO is the longest-running project on the Ethereum blockchain. The project has more than 2.3 million Ethereum in its protocol, about 2% of the total Ethereum in circulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, the MakerDAO team has 11 members. Besides Rune Christensen, who is the CEO, the core members of the team are:</p>



<ul><li>Steven Becker, (COO)</li><li>Andy Milenius (CTO)</li><li>Soren Peter Nielsen (Head of product)</li><li>Jacek Czamecki (General Counsel)</li><li>Arran Kitson (Senior Digital Asset Analyst)</li><li>Matthew Cooper (Business Development, Account Manager)</li><li>Gustav Arentoft (Business Development)</li></ul>

<h2 id=""><br></h2>



<h2 id="makerdao-technology-and-advantages">MakerDAO Technology and Advantages</h2>



<p>MakerDAO has several advantages that make it a key player in the decentralized finance ecosystem. They are as below:</p>



<h4 id="it-solves-the-tether-usdt-problem">It solves the Tether (USDT) problem</h4>



<p>The use of stable coins is not unique to MakerDAO. In fact, the most widely used stable coin in the market is Tether (USDT). However, Tether has several problems that make it a weak link for the entire crypto ecosystem. One of the disadvantages of<a href="https://capital.com/research-80-of-stablecoin-tether-is-controlled-by-300-addresses"> Tether</a> is that it is centralized. It is run by the same people who run Bitfinex, and there are controversies around it. In a situation where the people behind Bitfinex go under, Tether could collapse as well.</p>



<p>&nbsp;MakerDAO stable coins do not have this problem because they are decentralized. Unlike Tether generated from a central source, new DAIs are created through user-generated collateralized debt positions (CDPs).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Users lock-in Ethereum in smart contract pools and create CDPs. It is the CDP that then makes the user&#8217;s DAI while giving out interest on the total Ethereum pooled. In essence, there is no single point of failure for DAI. This stable coin would be a safe bet if USDT fails.</p>



<h4 id="it-creates-transparency-in-the-crypto-ecosystem">It creates transparency in the crypto ecosystem</h4>



<p>Centralized coins dominate the stable coin ecosystem. While they work pretty fine, there is always the issue of transparency. For instance, if a single source only generates a stable coin, the market can never know if the coins in circulation are backed 1:1 by actual dollars. This poses a risk because a discrepancy could lead to collapse and negatively impact the entire crypto ecosystem.</p>



<p>MakerDAO stable coins do not have this problem. That&#8217;s because the DAI stable coins are created through collateralized debt positions, as mentioned above. As such, there can never be a hole in the funding of all DAI in circulation.</p>



<h4 id="makerdao-solves-the-bitcoin-manipulation-problem">MakerDAO solves the Bitcoin manipulation problem</h4>



<p>There has been a growing issue in crypto with regards to Bitcoin Tether manipulation. Reports are showing that anytime new Tether enters circulation, the price of Bitcoin rises. Even more damning are reports that up to 80% of Bitcoin&#8217;s value is derived from Tether.</p>



<p>MakerDAO stable coins solve this problem because all DAI&#8217;s generated are recorded on the blockchain, and execute based on instructions put on the smart contract. This makes it a solution to the problem of Bitcoin manipulation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="445"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dao3.png"  alt="money MKR &amp; DAI"  class="wp-image-30158"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dao3.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dao3.png 1024w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dao3.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dao3.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dao3.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dao3.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dao3.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dao3.png 1280w"  sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" ></figure>



<h2 id="how-does-makerdao-work"><br>How does MakerDAO work?</h2>



<p>MakerDAO is a credit facility that gives loans at a predetermined interest rate. The process starts with an Ethereum deposit into a Maker smart contract, which creates a collateralized debt position (CDP).&nbsp;</p>



<p>For context, if Ethereum is trading at $100 and a user deposits 1 Ethereum at a hypothetical collateralized rate of 150%, they would be allowed to receive 40 DAI. If the price of Ethereum drops below $100, the user gets automatically closed out of their position. For such a user to get their Ethereum back from the MakerDAO, they would need to pay back the amount they received and a fee. The same concept applies to any amount of Ethereum and at any price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The entire system is controlled by a MakerDAO native token called MKR. Holders of the MKR token have control of various aspects of the protocol that includes annual borrowing, the amount of collateral for CDPs, and shutting down in case of an emergency Ethereum crash. It is the MKR that also makes the MakerDAO a fully decentralized system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is also important to note that when fees are paid, a dollar value of the MKR is bought out of the market, and used to pay the stability fee. The working of MakerDAO can be summed up in the loop cycle below:</p>



<ol><li>User opens a collateralized debt position</li><li>If Ethereum depreciates, the user gets closed out and pays a fee.</li><li>If Ethereum price appreciates, the user draws DAI from the CDP</li><li>The user buys more Ethereum with newly created DAI&nbsp;</li><li>The user adds more Ethereum to their CDP to protect against a drop in Ethereum value.</li><li>Cycle repeats.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<h2 id="perspectives-and-takeaways"><br>Perspectives and takeaways</h2>



<p>While decentralized finance is still way off from going mainstream, it is gaining traction. This is driven by the fact that huge segments of the world population do not have access to centralized financial systems. As an alternative decentralized system takes root, MakerDAO and its decentralized lending ecosystem will grow too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On top of that, the issue of Bitcoin control by Tether will ultimately drive the market towards decentralized stable coins, and MakerDAO is one of the oldest and most tested on this front. The MakerDAO is also constantly innovating and recently introduced multi-collateral DAI. This entails allowing users to make DAI stable coins that are backed by multiple crypto assets.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="views-on-makerdao"><br>Views on MakerDAO</h2>



<p>Since its launch, the MakerDAO has grown in popularity because it is at the core of decentralized finance. With more people getting into decentralized finance, commentary on DAI in the media by top voices in crypto has been on the rise. In 2018, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1050778499307450368">twitted</a> that, &#8220;MakerDAO is great&#8221; and got lots of positive feedback about it.</p>

<p>Another interesting comment is by Arentoft concerning the launch of <a href="https://blockchain.news/news/makerdaoon-the-significance-of-multi-collateral-dai-and-dai-savings-rate">multi collateral DAI</a>. He stated that &#8220;It&#8217;s very similar to having a US dollar-denominated savings account. It works as a form of staking, the savings accounts will take some part of the profits from the system and distribute them back to the users on the system. One of the benefits of having a decentralized system is that we don&#8217;t have to abide by traditional monetary policy but can instead focus a lot more on helping people.&#8221;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chainlink-Guide-1920x1080.png"  alt="Chainlink cover"  class="wp-image-30051" ></figure>



<p>Understanding cryptocurrency and all the available types is a pretty deep process. One that stands out as being reliable is Chainlink. This cryptocurrency was developed on a platform that connects the world of smart contracts to real-world applications using blockchain technology. A smart contract is a way of facilitating the trade of money for a service or product. It uses “oracles,” a third-party service, to connect the smart contract to the real-word data.</p>



<p>Blockchains use math to encrypt them and keep them safe. Each blockchain is its own unit, separate from other blockchains. Trying to get information into the blockchain from the real world is tricky and makes the vulnerable. Chainlink uses a network of nodes, a type of middleman, between the real world and different blockchains to keep them safe while linking to traditional payment systems with sacrificing security. This article discusses how Chainlink uses smart contracts and cryptocurrency to provide goods and services to users.</p>



<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-chainlink"><br>A Brief History of Chainlink</h2>



<p>Sergey Nazarov, the current CEO, and Steve Ellis, the current CTO, founded Chainlink in 2014. Their initial coin offering in 2017 raised $32 million and created 1 billion LINK tokens. They launched on Ethereum in May of 2019. Both Nazarov and Ellis showed interest in the cryptocurrency world back in 2011.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="445"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chain2-1.png"  alt="chainlink 2014"  class="wp-image-30195"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chain2-1.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chain2-1.png 1024w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chain2-1.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chain2-1.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chain2-1.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chain2-1.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chain2-1.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chain2-1.png 1280w"  sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" ></figure>



<p>There are two main architectural components to Chainlink. There is the on-chain infrastructure that consists of oracle contracts deployed by Ethereum. Then there is the off-chain infrastructure, which processes the requests from users. These two architectures work in tandem to secure the cryptocurrency and protect the people who have invested in it. It has a three-step verification process for every transaction.</p>



<h2 id="chainlink-technology-and-advantages"><br>Chainlink Technology and Advantages</h2>



<p>Chainlink uses its unique structure to close the vulnerability gap between decentralized applications (DApps) and the outside world. Chainlink protects the data points that can be manipulated, falsified or compromised, keeping hackers from easily getting a hold of user’s information and stealing it as well as their cryptocurrency. It also uses technology to secure hardware and provide “trusted-execution environments” for each transaction.</p>



<p>It is a decentralized oracle network that provides data to people who are willing to pay for it. The user identifies the data they need, and using smart contracts, Chainlink gathers the data from providers and returns it to the user securely. So where does the cryptocurrency part of it come in?</p>



<p>When the user picks the data they need from the system; providers bid on the request so that they are the ones that send the data. The providers have to put up LINK tokens when they bid on the request. If the provider wins the bid, they send the data onto the blockchain for the user to collect. If the provider misbehaves, such as providing incorrect or false data, they lose the LINK tokens they put up. If the oracle reputation system approves the data, the provider gets paid.</p>



<p>LINK tokens can be earned by being a provider or by purchasing them on cryptocurrency sites.</p>



<h2 id="perspectives-and-takeaways"><br>Perspectives and Takeaways</h2>



<p>Chainlink continues to grow, and their main objective is to ensure security on the network through the distribution of data and the oracles that check the data. Currently, it is building its network of users and operators in the hopes of becoming more robust with networking that is valuable. They are looking for new partnerships as well as promoting cryptocurrency education, events and relationships.</p>



<p>Up until Chainlink launched, there was no bridge between smart contracts on blockchain systems and the real world. Businesses who refused to use blockchain technology had no access to smart chains. By bridging the gap and providing oracles that decentralize the process used to access the smart contracts, Chainlink provided businesses with a way to utilize them. It is currently the only cryptocurrency that does this.</p>

<h3 id="chainlink-provides"><br>Chainlink provides:</h3>



<ul><li>A highly decentralized and secure infrastructure manned by teams of node operators that have been cleared of security issues and with strong Sybil resistance</li><li>High-quality data sources that are validated rigorously with multiple accuracy checks before the smart contract is triggered</li><li>End-to-end security for your smart contract that is easily verifiable and immutable</li><li>A shared data resource that is well maintained through an open-source community</li><li>Time-tested and proven oracle networks that provide tamper-resistance</li><li>Longest running DeFi oracle to secure assets</li><li>Smart contracts connected to real market prices expected by the users</li></ul>



<p>Chainlink prices are expected to continue climbing as more cryptocurrency users start looking for better ways to obtain data and pay for them. The cryptocurrency community is driving the climb thanks to education efforts on smart contracts and how they are used.</p>



<h2 id="views-on-chainlink"><br>Views On Chainlink</h2>



<p>“We really did our due diligence and looked around, and we said well Chainlink is definitely the most established, and every time we dealt with them the level of expertise was incredible, so I feel like we are in good hands.” – Justin Moses, CTO, Synthetix</p>



<p>“Working with Chainlink for v3’s oracle requirements made perfect sense. More than anything, we appreciate the fact that they are equally unwilling as us to compromise on security guarantees – that’s what stands out.” – Daniel Wang, CEO, Loopring</p>



<p>“Ethereum Dapps (i.e. smart contract applications) request data from Chainlink, which in turn retrieves data from a web service built with Google App Engine and Big Query.” – Allen Day, Science Advocate, Google</p>



<p>“In sum, Google’s partnership with Chainlink enables Ethereum app builders using Google software to integrate data from and to sources outside the blockchain.” Avivah Litan, VP Distinguished Analyst, Gartner</p>



<p>“We’re convinced of the importance of middleware solutions, and it has been great to watch the Chainlink project evolve from initial concept to a fully executed and widely needed tool that infinitely expands the usefulness of smart contract blockchain platforms.” – Fran Strajnar, Co-Founder and Chairman, BNC</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="445"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chain1.png"  alt="store LINK"  class="wp-image-30062"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chain1.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chain1.png 1024w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chain1.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chain1.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chain1.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chain1.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chain1.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chain1.png 1280w"  sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" ></figure>



<p>Even though Chainlink’s native ERC20 tokens are only a little over a year old, they can be purchased in over 10 cryptocurrency exchanges. Most of the exchanges accept Bitcoin and Ether, although a few can also take ETH and Tether. LINK cannot be acquired on an exchange that takes fiat currencies at this time.</p>



<p>Because Chainlink is on the Ethereum blockchain, it can be stored and managed by any wallet that supports Ethereum and ERC20 tokens.</p>



<p>Chainlink is currently supported by Atomic Wallet. This software wallet will let you manage and exchange Chainlink among other 60+ assets anonymously and securely right in the interface. You have total control over your funds, and your private keys are unique being generated by a mnemonic seed. It never leaves your device. Atomic Wallet provides solutions to storing, sending, and exchanging Chainlink. It has its own backend to aggregate data from different sources that provides reliable data for users. However, the team is looking into the addition of LINK oracle as one of our trusted sources.</p>



<h2 id="conclusion"><br>Conclusion</h2>



<p>By utilizing smart contracts, businesses get tamper-proof digital agreements that are highly secure and reliable. They protect both sides of the business deal and provides overall reliability that the input and output of the contract are secure. This is the service Chainlink providers to members of the cryptocurrency community.</p>



<p>Chainlink is the bridge between real-world data and smart contracts. It is the only platform in the cryptocurrency market that offers this service. It provides users the data they need from providers who bid to fulfill that need safely and efficiently. It offers a service for individuals and businesses who wish to use cryptocurrency as payment while remaining secure.</p>



<p>Chainlink is great for settling loans, liquidating collateral, calculating interest payments, converting assets such as gold to tokens, and management assets. Using the Chainlink ecosystem, users are given full visibility to the price fees and the teams that are participating in them, movement on LINK prices, and the reports necessary to make informed decisions before triggering the next smart contract.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tL4KFUtQ5Fp8jEhiDhJKxixk4m18Z6NpiSZCZQbLR_-bRE-D8aOBigVPIzTZmz41S-oCuqQv8YCH3M3dgkNz-mncw8U67dqyL5BX3Wp6UWHFzEVq4K9fnwCm5YrTUQSfdPx4qvs"  alt="The Best Cryptocurrencies to Invest in 2020 " ></figure>



<p>Cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency and payment system that doesn’t rely on the traditional payment networks we have become accustomed to. All the Best Cryptocurrencies are <em>decentralized</em>. They are not issued by a central authority, like a bank or a government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cryptocurrencies are based on <em>blockchain technology </em>– a network of computers completely independent from centralized control who keep a track record of all the transactions of the past and those that will be carried out in the future.</p>



<p>Investing in cryptocurrencies is becoming more and more popular every year. It is a global investment opportunity available to anyone in any part of the world. They are a highly profitable instrument, very volatile and they bear a certain risk factor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cryptocurrencies are becoming an acceptable means of payment worldwide. Blockchain technology is reliable, it cannot be counterfeited, manipulated or changed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No other technology makes it possible to send money from one part of the world to the other without an intermediary to carry out the transaction. It is the most affordable means to send money from point A to point B known today.</p>



<p>You are in full control of your money! No questions are asked. All you need is a computer or a mobile phone and you can transact with whoever you want when you want it!</p>



<p>Speed is what makes cryptocurrencies different from traditional banking. While a bank transfer can sometimes take up to 2-3 days, a cryptocurrency transaction is settled in a few minutes. Some are confirmed within seconds but more about that later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what else makes cryptocurrencies so valuable? Their supply is limited. A Maximum supply means the maximum amount of coins that will ever exist for a certain cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let us think about this for a moment. How is the paper money we use every day created? It is simple. It gets printed by Central Banks and governments when they need it! Bitcoin doesn’t work that way. You cannot press a button and create more Bitcoins or add new sheets of paper to the printing press. Cryptocurrencies are scarce. The smaller the amount of an important asset there is in existence the more valuable it becomes.</p>



<p>Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies are created by a method known as <em>mining</em>. Mining refers to solving complex math problems that produce new bitcoin. More information about mining is available here.</p>



<h2 id="how-much-to-invest-in-cryptocurrencies">How Much to Invest in Cryptocurrencies?</h2>



<p>Anyone who has access to a computer or a mobile phone can invest in cryptocurrencies. Everyone can afford them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Depending on your budget and your goals you can invest as little as $1 or several $1000. There are no limitations to what you can do. The only limitations can be set by the exchange on which you are buying your cryptocurrencies. Especially to young people, cryptocurrencies are seen as the fastest way to obtain wealth.</p>



<p>Always remember to invest only what you can afford to lose and diversify your portfolio. “<em>Don’t put all your eggs in one basket”.</em></p>



<p>Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology are still at its early stages and these assets will dominate the market in a few years. Our generation has been given a chance to invest in the future of the Internet. 30 years ago, during the .com era, many of us didn’t have a chance to participate. Will we make the right decision now?</p>



<h2 id="top-cryptocurrencies-to-buy-in-2020">Top Cryptocurrencies to Buy in 2020</h2>



<p>#1 Bitcoin</p>



<p>Bitcoin is the first and the world’s biggest and most popular cryptocurrency on the market. It was created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, an anonymous software developer whose identity has not been revealed to this day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He had a vision of an independent payment method that could be transferred without using banks. A crypto portfolio without Bitcoin is hard to think of.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are several reasons why Bitcoin has always been considered as a reasonable investment. Bitcoin is decentralized – there is no central institution controlling the supply of Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/TJSUmawFjTcxZRfEW_uepfoe7Bf1RnB7mVF33UYh8awSE8kQWp9BfM7Ez8KMBklw_-7s9XlfrV1_Bn9It_U69wmaY9A_y0Cr1dSW4XVHSf6132n_pyDTra35VnXokyxXmPbHcZ4"  alt="Bitcoin price" ></figure>



<p>The supply of Bitcoin is limited. Fiat currencies can be printed whenever they are needed and they are unlimited in supply. Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million Bitcoins and over 18 million has already been mined.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitcoin transactions are anonymous. Since Bitcoin is not governed by a central entity, users don’t have to identify themselves to be able to transact.</p>



<p>Irreversibility. Once confirmed, Bitcoin transactions can’t be reversed, changed or deleted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The story of one investor who paid 10,000 Bitcoins for a pizza in 2010 is well known in crypto circles. An investment that would have been worth over $80 million today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>May 22 is celebrated as the yearly Bitcoin Pizza Day to remember the day when Laszlo Hanyecz spent 10,000 Bitcoins on pizza.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What does 2020 hold for Bitcoin? Bitcoin is still the best and safest cryptocurrency investment. The entire crypto market moves in parallel with Bitcoin.</p>



<p>In May 2020 an important event will take place known as <em>Bitcoin Halving.</em> A halving happens once every 4 years (every 210,000 blocks). It is expected that this event will boost Bitcoin&#8217;s price by 10x or more like it did in the past.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the day of the &#8216;halving&#8217;, the block reward will be reduced from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC per block. In 2012 was the first halving. One year after the event the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed from $11 to $1,100$. After the second halving, the price of Bitcoin rose from $700 to over $20,000 at the end of 2017.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/F6Jk1izBUbCWqvyioKZyMmt3zUXmRTyFtEOtN0VBpA2Rh6bnrgIIavZWmG7aklbwUZON5UzSNgZx3IAWJ84wN7xbdhIs9kFhOSXFjBeIW6nVlbuK0M0N5HriAi4c-fBAEeUZgKM"  alt="Bitcoin Marketplace." ></figure>



<p>What can we expect after the 3<sup>rd</sup> halving? Many experts agree that after the next halving we can expect the price to go to $100,000 per BTC. Don’t miss your chance!</p>

<p>#2 Ethereum</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/aTTuyJjHpu6E-wsXmIiQpTosMWCy46Y31uDcw4YKBzcwsuwZ7lmKUyYFgFtRnTBDg1ZILfQ1znN1P-acZg9O9yB_i8gO0zUoTAC2oT5ysMe2ugQ2OMwhKYtMLtNFRypSAMNnSAw"  alt="Ethereum" ></figure>



<p>Ethereum is the 2<sup>nd</sup> largest cryptocurrency in terms of <a href="https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/fundamental-analysis/understanding-market-capitalization">market capitalization</a> and on top of the list for daily <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">traded volume</a>.</p>



<p>It was created by Vitalik Buterin in 2014 and it is the largest platform for <em>decentralized applications</em> also known as <a href="https://hackernoon.com/what-are-decentralized-applications-dapps-3b63b4d587fe"><em>DApps</em></a>. Ethereum is the platform and Ether is the currency used on the Ethereum platform.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/GzmSyZ9IY4CaKFlysydqqKnzwfnqJKAIPBAx_1cASVDtHbGnvnQsWitJcWzXwtvLtT_J6L0fsBsG3Fktj9e6ZDLhTZI197wyXTjr-K2p63cE7K6SJio3cUF_Q1v8XRVNMVF_ETA"  alt="Ethereum Statistics" ></figure>



<p>Ether was traded at the price of $0.40 back in 2015. It reached its all-time-high at the beginning of 2018 when 1 ETH was worth over $1,400. Ether is today worth 4,177% more than it was at the time of its launch.</p>



<p>Just like Bitcoin, the Ethereum platform is decentralized and it allows people to connect directly through a powerful supercomputer without the need for a central authority.</p>



<p>How does Ethereum work? Ethereum works thanks to <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/350322/what-is-ethereum-and-what-are-smart-contracts/"><em>Smart Contracts</em></a><em> </em>– a set of conditions and actions created by their developers and executed by the network taking into consideration a set of defined rules<em>.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>To understand Ethereum, take a look at the following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxLkbJozKbY">YouTube video</a> explaining all the basics:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is Ethereum still a good investment in 2020? Yes, it is! It is because of the capabilities of its Smart Contracts that Ethereum is so popular and valuable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smart Contracts can be configured with certain conditions. Once those conditions have been met the Ethereum Network can facilitate agreed-upon actions that will help companies perform better and more efficient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ethereum transactions are very cheap and the <a href="https://www.binance.vision/glossary/confirmation-time"><em>confirmation time</em></a><em> </em>can be as fast as 15-20 seconds. This makes Ether currency a perfect instrument for the transfer of money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now is a great opportunity to stack up on Ethereum because in 2020 <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ethereum-2-0-launch-2020/">Ethereum 2.0</a> is being released! Ethereum 2.0 will improve security and enable even faster transactions.</p>

<p><a href="https://eos.io/about-us/">EOS</a> is an open-source blockchain development platform designed to be used for businesses around the world. The EOS network can process millions of transactions every second making it faster compared to giants such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.</p>



<p>EOS raised <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/the-first-yearlong-ico-for-eos-raised-4-billion-the-second-just-2-8-million">$4 Billion</a> in their one year long ICO campaign, breaking all records to this day.</p>



<p>There are many benefits in using the EOS blockchain: It is one of the fastest cryptocurrencies today and is offering zero transaction fees. As a user, you can send money with EOS for free! The developers of EOS are aiming at building the fastest and easiest to use blockchain in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Owning EOS tokens makes the users eligible to airdrops for new EOS-based projects in the future. EOS is rewarding its holders with new tokens.</p>



<p>EOS initially began as an ERC-20 token hosted on the Ethereum network, but since June 2018 it is using its native <a href="https://cryptorunner.com/neo-vs-eos/">EOS network</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is a dominant player in the DApps market. Among the top 30 DApps today, EOS is hosting 22 of them, dominating Ethereum in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right now, 2/3 best-ranked DApps according to <a href="https://dappradar.com/rankings">https://dappradar.com/rankings</a> are hosted on the EOS platform!<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/viGRz5t2dL4vt-IxqMSC4rraAIuSDQIEePpicL-sUyQF_pvswm4dmr6tvOOWTfSJ2KLd558nyTMRwcwSF0rRuK6s0PIsf5UTUu2ey85oEMfS4Kf_R6k7YlbA9k-LB-yEn5qlhqo"  alt="Dapp ranking" ></figure>



<p>Those investing in EOS have reasons to be excited. PayPal co-founder and billionaire Peter Thiel is an investor and believer in EOS. Thiel is famous for picking out winners early on. His investment portfolio includes the likes of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/eos-new-btc-pay-attention-peter-thiel/">Facebook, SpaceX, and Airbnb</a>.</p>

<p>EOS is currently trading at around $2.43.</p>

<p>The true value of EOS can also be seen from the next example. EOS is a US-based project and it is ranked #1 in China in a recently released <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-releases-year-end-crypto-rankings/">year-end crypto rankings list</a> that evaluated and ranked the top 35 cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>Many experts agree that the beginning of 2020 is a great opportunity to buy more EOS tokens. Predictions suggest that the prices are likely to re-test the <a href="https://capital.com/eos-price-prediction">$8-9 areas</a> making EOS a profitable investment right now.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cRWrjirc_QCrFdL-QfkOuKeMZbkjVg8TZK3YUDy2eG2SDh0zJstYyfRDL4eyULJi6fHUeaRSVjcoW1bFBJLrddOofdd5JXcgUcfYtLAHiE9ynn2OlyQ9OGYXJ9mYM3uwLB5E2PE"  alt="Litecoin" ></figure>



<p>Source: <a href="https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Litecoin-Logo.png">https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Litecoin-Logo.png</a><br></p>



<p>Litecoin is a <a href="https://gem.co/crypto-101/what-is-a-fork/">fork</a> of Bitcoin and a global decentralized open-source payment network.</p>



<p>It has an experienced development team working on it, headed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Lee_(computer_scientist)">Charlie Lee</a> who worked for Google and Coinbase.</p>



<p>Litecoin is a very innovative coin and it has introduced several improvements and innovations to blockchain technology that were later accepted and implemented by Bitcoin as well. Those include <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/segwit-segregated-witness.asp"><em>SegWit</em></a> and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atomic-swaps.asp"><em>Atomic Swaps</em></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>Litecoin has recently celebrated its 8<sup>th</sup> birthday and is considered to be a very stable payment option.</p>



<p></p>

<p>In terms of daily volume, Litecoin is one of the most used cryptocurrencies because of its <a href="https://litecoin.org/">instant, near-zero cost transactions</a>. This also makes Litecoin a great option to use to purchase other cryptocurrencies. It has over 400 <a href="https://cryptocurrencyfacts.com/what-are-trading-pairs-in-cryptocurrency/">trading pairs</a> available on a long list of exchanges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just like with Bitcoin, Litecoin also goes through a halving event every four years. On 5 Aug 2019, the block rewards were reduced from 25 LTC to 12.5 LTC. The value of Litecoin has not yet profited from the halving event, but this is expected to happen in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>US-based provider of investment data <em>Weiss Ratings</em> has ranked Litecoin as excellent in regards to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/weiss-ratings-litecoin-excellent-in-adoption-and-investment-returns">investment rewards and adoption</a>.</p>



<p>Litecoin often called “<em>Silver to Bitcoin’s Gold</em>”, has successfully solved Bitcoin’s slower speed of confirming transactions. Litecoin blocks are produced once every 2.5 minutes compared to Bitcoin’s 10-minute block creation time.</p>



<p>The developers behind Litecoin have now focused their attention on privacy and are planning to introduce <em>Confidential Transactions</em>. If privacy matters to you, Litecoin is a coin that needs to become a part of your portfolio!</p>

<p>Tron is a blockchain-based decentralized platform that aims to build a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-tron-trx/">free, global entertainment system</a> allowing users to publish and store their content on the network for free, and being the real owners of their data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main problem today is that big corporations, such as Netflix or YouTube, own the content we create.</p>



<p>The goal of Tron is to bring closer content creators and consumers by eliminating middlemen resulting in cost reductions and more profit for content creators. Guaranteed with no censorship and third-party control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tron was founded in 2017 by the Tron Foundation and is headed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Sun">Justin Sun</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tron has its own cryptocurrency called <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/">Tronix (TRX)</a>. The coins can be used by Tron subscribers to pay and access the content they like on the Tron network and award content creators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tron is becoming more and more popular every day, gaining huge interest from the public.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6gu5hGHo6qT7Q3LTjFSSk9uDCMvaGbRaTe45SMi-Y6aC-Bv7aUBnEci4VQSMTX15aXwohW9tWhXKV9vbkHLP4m-ueLzMZ-4mRQSqVLgDYFmVF_P-atXdGsNEqyZxXPJj4knvhxo"  alt="Tron" ></figure>

<p>Tron has recently acquired <a href="https://www.bittorrent.com/">BitTorrent</a>, a peer-to-peer file sharing service with over 100 million users. Its native BitTorrent token will now run on the Tron Network giving a huge boost to Tron’s ecosystem.</p>



<p>Tron has its DApps. Most of them revolve around gaming and gambling because Tron is aiming at becoming the biggest entertainment platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few days ago, Tron tickled the minds of their userbase by announcing that a new game is in development and being released around Christmas.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gY3EIMmJdyEs6ZGydxHrFbX-WmmrkwMDv7MyXmU0eQczELRjFyrmYrKQqGJdd3xgqa2KJTIcJpOmP4u_oQZd5G5Y1XUPpgviKA28CbHlL4OcwFZy2Frlj1Pgo-_QuiASTQYYX7g"  alt="TeamJust Tweet" ></figure>

<p>Tron has one of the biggest roadmaps I have ever seen. The last stage of development is planned for <a href="https://globalcoinreport.com/tron-trx-road-map-success/">2037</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The future of the Internet is decentralized and a decentralized entertainment platform is needed. Tron is a long-term investment that will eventually pay off.</p>

<p>Cosmos is a decentralized network of <a href="https://cosmos.network/intro">independent and parallel blockchains</a>. It is an ecosystem of blockchains that work together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cosmos aims to make it possible for different blockchains to transact with each other creating an <em>Internet of Blockchains</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By using <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/tendermint-explained-bringing-bft-based-pos-to-the-public-blockchain-domain-f22e274a0fdb"><em>Tendermint BFT</em></a> and <a href="https://docs.cosmos.network/"><em>Cosmos SDK</em></a> Cosmos makes it easy for developers to develop blockchains and make full use of all their powers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than 80 projects have chosen Cosmos SDK to build their blockchains.</p>



<p>The developers of Cosmos have noticed that many of the top blockchains of today are simply too slow and the transaction fees are too high. With their interconnected blockchains, they aim to solve that.</p>



<p>This is one of the rare projects that have managed to debut in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3C_8NabWLo">TOP 20 on CoinMarketCap</a> and have remained there ever since.</p>



<p>Cosmos has already attracted several elite partners. Most notably, the <a href="https://www.coinbureau.com/review/cosmos-atom/">Binance token emitting platform</a>, Binance DEX, is built on the Cosmos ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ncrtng5gl1JDQ3gSHpOOoTTQ1inQKuWlnZeg9lAtOfKKBVpDlYVmSwnpndSiZDPti0yJOUoM5IXgq5v3jSEpgF4omyppOi4IKC78K1X7W1RyC-ZqwA1tIKhxvXQleOKaF97MxUQ"  alt="" ></figure>

<p>They held a highly successful ICO in 2017, raising over $17 million in just 28 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Cosmos development team is very active on GitHub and one of the most active ones in the crypto industry. A lot of work is being done on building the protocol.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a serious project that investors should take note of in 2020. Cosmos has moved to its main net and been listed on reputable exchanges, such as Binance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Binance supports the <a href="https://www.binance.vision/blockchain/what-is-staking"><em>staking</em></a> of <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/articles/360037516831">Cosmos (ATOM) tokens</a>.</p>

<p>Tezos is a completely new blockchain project that is not based on any existing platforms. Just like Ethereum, it uses smart contracts. But, Tezos can process 40-50 transactions per second, more than double what Ethereum can.</p>



<p>Tezos cares for its community and userbase. Their stakeholders will be able to <a href="https://www.coinbureau.com/review/tezos-xtz/">vote on innovations</a> without doing <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hard-fork.asp"><em>hard forks</em></a> which could result in a divided community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All holders of Tezos tokens work together and vote on decisions to improve their network. The development team can’t control the decision making without support from the community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tezos is a TOP 10 ranked cryptocurrency on <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tezos/">CoinMarketCap</a>. It is listed on reputable exchanges, such as Binance, Kraken, and OKEx and does very well in terms of liquidity.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/iPS0qB1NkbbuAFzs8S-k3tkQfsxAVdXuFs7GCcQB7UQakIsoUGUmsNF5FI53ggCieNjbwmo1ZXiDXV_ysssneVw0ZwGfRo5W8KZTmhL2-nn9YHFip-KvbxsJbH6GQvP5NsMsSuo"  alt="Tezos" ></figure>



<p>On 30 June 2018, Tezos moved to its main net and received a positive reaction from the market. The Tezos developers are aiming at building a far more superior blockchain compared to the competition. Compared to Bitcoin, Tezos requires <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UB6oz638uc">much less mining power</a>.</p>



<p>Tezos made headlines after it was announced that this cryptocurrency was added to the <a href="https://winklevosscapital.com/portfolio/">portfolio</a> of <a href="https://winklevosscapital.com/portfolio/">Winklevoss Capital</a>, an investment company founded by two US entrepreneurs known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winklevoss_twins">Winklevoss twins</a>.</p>



<p>Cameron Winklevoss made a short tweet in July supporting the project by saying: “<em>Love Tezos</em>”.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/rjWpAXuHKGiR--2GUSMnAh6hOnsyR7p4RaR532679fMQhr4VhQfGNlgZmjJASRHG-PhgKdQp3wc7dIh3FRodzKwRVZMT-VqsBG-VgwzImxQXkWEPTepV3CVAg9tyvgVINyihV1s"  alt="Cameron Winklevoss" ></figure>

<p>2019 has been a very positive year for Tezos and investors are slowly realizing all the benefits this revolutionary project can bring them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tezos has signed partnerships with several important partners. It has become <a href="https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/tezos-makes-great-progress-in-2019-new-partnerships-and-goals/"><em>the first blockchain to update automatically without using a hard fork</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>When it comes to the value of the coins, Tezos has witnessed significant growth increasing its value from $0.47 to the current $1.49. The future looks good for Tezos holders.</p>

<p>BAT is an open-source and blockchain-based <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/about/">digital advertising platform</a>. It is an ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With BAT, everyone profits. Advertisers award publishers with BAT tokens based on the attention their ads receive by users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Users receive BAT tokens just by participating and viewing ads.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The current advertising industry faces many problems for users, publishers, and advertisers alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They violate the privacy of users, spread malware, and decrease mobile phone battery life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Publishers can’t monetize their ads because platforms like Google and Facebook take most of the profits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BAT introduces a <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/about/">transparent advertisement exchange</a> that consists of two stages.</p>



<p>Stage 1 is a new browser – the <a href="http://www.brave.com/">Brave Browser</a>. A privacy-focused browser that captures user attention and accurately rewards publishers. User attention is accurately and privately monitored and rewarded accordingly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not only that but Brave also blocks all ads and trackers that users don’t want to see, without exceptions. This makes the browser up to 3 times faster compared to other browsers.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>Stage 2 is the Basic Attention Token that is used to obtain advertising services and exchanged between all participants of the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The BAT ICO made history back in 2017 when the token sale raised $35 Million in just <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/35-million-30-seconds-token-sale-internet-browser-brave-sells">30 seconds</a>!</p>



<p>The development team behind the project is highly qualified.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The founder of Brave is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich">Brendan Eich</a>, the creator of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, and <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/about/">co-founder of Mozilla Firefox</a>. The other team members are equally impressive having previously worked for Mozilla, Tor, AOL, and Yahoo before switching to Brave.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brave is already a popular browser boosting <a href="https://publishers.basicattentiontoken.org/">280,000 content creators and publishers</a>. Brands like The Washington Post, The Guardian or Wikipedia rely on the Brave Browser.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.publish0x.com/">Publish0x</a> shows how easy it is to earn BAT tokens. Publish0x is a blogging platform powered by cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Registered users can read quality content and earn BAT tokens in return. Users on Publish0x earn by blogging and tipping quality content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every time you tip an author, part of the tip (usually 20%) goes to your wallet. The BAT token is the most popular crypto on this up-and-coming platform.</p>



<p>The Basic Attention Token has a solid foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is based on a working product – the Brave Browser, and an experienced high-quality team with a proven track record.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As more and more people are starting to become concerned for their privacy it is expected that 2020 becomes the year of Basic Attention Token.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>BAT tokens can be stored in the Atomic Wallet that is available for all major Operating Systems, <a href="https://atomicwallet.io/ethereum-wallet">https://atomicwallet.io/ethereum-wallet</a>.

<p>#9 Binance Coin<br></p>

<p>Binance Coin or, BNB, is the native token of the <a href="https://www.binance.com/en../../buy-Binance-Coin">Binance blockchain</a>. Binance is one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. The more people trade on Binance, the better the value of the BNB tokens!</p>



<p>Holders of BNB can enjoy 25% discounted trading fees but it can also be used to pay for hotels and flight booking, the purchase of gift cards, and as a means to buy IEO tokens with.</p>



<p>In March 2019 Binance introduced a 2<sup>nd</sup> exchange – <a href="https://www.binance.org/">The Binance Decentralized Exchange (DEX)</a> offering even more utility for the BNB tokens.</p>



<p>BNB has experienced impressive gains in 2019. The value of the token rose from $6 at the beginning of the year to $39 in July.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is currently trading at around $14 per token and is a TOP 10 coin according to CoinMarketCap.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img  src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pi2UI5k42eUWHBTa-TxpNUE38m41-Dnbcq5mfvur-p7LGe_RZ1VGDFbrfoT-qaVnK5ESQ9NUgUnIsib3Jhq9ZrO-j6DqQtLoweKkw7Yb6Ecg87K-h6LQOErPjSwyKwyvcoy3amo"  alt="Binance coin charts" ></figure>



<p>Source <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/">https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/</a><br></p>



<p>Binance plans to buy back and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/explained/token-burning-explained"><em>burn</em></a> 50% of the total supply of BNB tokens. The burning is done quarterly and depends on the <a href="https://releaseyourdigitaltalent.com/why-binance-coin-has-great-benefits/">trading volume</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This process rewards the holders of the tokens because the value of the existing supply is boosted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last buyback and burning event took place during <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/391462665575727104/9th-BNB-Burn-Q3-2019-Recap-from-CZ">July/September 2019</a> when Binance burned an equivalent of almost $37 million worth of BNB tokens.</p>

<p>Investor and crypto enthusiast, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9lVbBHnDNA">Dallas Rushing</a> makes a good point when he talks about BNB and what differentiates this project from many other projects. Binance uses its revenue to buy back BNB tokens, raising the price for all stakeholders. Similar projects don’t do that. They solely rely on buy and sell orders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another benefit of owning BNB tokens is in the possibility to take part in ICO and IEO investments on the Binance Launchpad. Investors can participate anonymously but they have to own BNB tokens to do so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if BNB was meant to be a native currency of the Binance exchange its popularity resulted in BNB being listed on several other popular exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The full list of exchanges is can be found here <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/markets/">https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/markets/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Binance Coin has received strong interest from institutional investors in recent weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This asset is part of the portfolio of Swiss stock exchange <a href="https://www.six-group.com/exchanges/index_en.html">SIX</a> since <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/institutions-are-showing-interest-in-etp-tied-to-binance-coin-amun-says">October 2019</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the managing director of this institution, Binance Coin is “<em>in a prime position to be one of the best performing large cap crypto assets of the next twelve months</em>.”</p>



<p>The popularity of Binance exchange among investors together with the use cases of Binance Coin makes me confident to say that BNB looks like a sure winner in 2020. A coin that looks certain to go up.</p>



<p>BNB can be stored in Atomic Wallet’s Binance Coin Wallet that manages and secures over 300 different coins and tokens. <a href="https://atomicwallet.io/binance-coin-wallet">https://atomicwallet.io/binance-coin-wallet</a></p>

<p>With the dedicated <em>doc.com Health app</em> users can receive medical assistance from doctors via a video call on their phone for free, 24 hours a day. The app is available for both Android and iPhone devices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the biggest investment in a project in crypto history!</p>



<p>You might rightly ask yourself: What does doc.com get in return for offering a free service? The answer is healthcare data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patients receive compensation in doc.com tokens for the anonymous data they provide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This data, together with analytics products, is shared with governments and the private healthcare industry. This allows them to monitor patients and react faster in case of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidpetersson/2018/11/28/free-telemedicine-and-telepsychology-coming-to-u-s-yes-for-real/#66a14e053ebb">health emergencies</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It makes absolute sense to store and share medical records with the help of blockchain technology. We have heard numerous cases of data breaches and since blockchains are un-hackable, and the data can’t be obtained without the corresponding private keys, doc.com is a gold mine waiting to be discovered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The doc.com blockchain provides accessibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Medical records are scattered between different institutions, hospitals, doctors, and they are hard to connect. A medical examination by one doctor is not recorded in the system of a doctor from another institution or country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchain keeps all the needed data at the same place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020, doc.com is planning to switch to a new blockchain. It is called <a href="https://doc.com/doc-token/">Lifechain</a>, and it will revolutionize the way we access healthcare.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/what-is-compoud2-1920x1080.png"  alt="compound cover"  class="wp-image-29193" ></figure>



<p>Compound (COMP) is an ERC20 token, a new form of cryptocurrency that gives you the power to debate, propose, and vote for changes on the Compound protocol. By owning COMP and supporting its governance, you can also generate interest income. In this article, we’ll tell you how COMP came about, its technology, and whether you can impact on how COMP is controlled.</p>



<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-compound-comp"><br>A Brief History of Compound (COMP)</h2>



<p>Founded by former economist Robert Leshner, the Compound (COMP) cryptocurrency features a Decentralized Finance – or DeFi – protocol. Using openly accessible smart contracts that have been built on the Ethereum platform, COMP allows its users to “borrow” tokens like they were taking out a loan. Token lenders lock the borrower’s crypto assets into the loan protocol.</p>



<p>The borrower pays interest rates that are based on the current supply and demand of the crypto asset. The interest rates are generated every time a block is mined. These loans can be paid back, and the borrowers locked assets released at any time. What is unique about this system is that users of cTokens, Compound’s native token, can earn interest in their money and transfer, trade, and use the money in other applications as needed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="445"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/comp1.png"  alt="compound pic 2"  class="wp-image-29204"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/comp1.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/comp1.png 1024w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/comp1.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/comp1.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/comp1.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/comp1.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/comp1.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/comp1.png 1280w"  sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" ></figure>



<h2 id="compound-comp-technology"><br>Compound (COMP) Technology</h2>



<p>While Compound looks like other DeFi lending protocols, allowing borrowers to use their crypto assets as collateral to borrow more, Compound’s cTokens are what stand out from the rest of available cryptocurrencies out there. cTokens are ERC20 tokens. They represent the user’s funds that have been deposited into Compound.</p>



<p>When users borrow against their cTokens, another type of token, such as USDC tokens are added to the borrowing protocol and locked into place. The borrower gets an equivalent amount of cTokens from the protocol in addition to generating tokens that earn interest for them. For example, when USDC tokens are used, they are converted to cUSDC. These tokens earn interest. When the borrower redeems their cUSDC tokens for normal USDC, they also get paid the interest earned in USDC.</p>



<p>As cTokens are converted in ERC20 form, users can move, trade, and use them in other decentralized applications. cTokens are a great example of how the DeFi movement is allowing different protocols to build different blocks, called “money legos.”</p>



<p>To have cTokens to use, borrow, or invest, users must deposit into the Compound protocol. New cTokens are then created. These tokens are based on the type of crypto asset the user deposits. For example, if borrowers use ETH as collateral against a loan, they get cETH in return. If they want to earn interest, they will use USDC. Using an Ethereum wallet, users can mint or create cTokens.</p>



<p>Compound cTokens can be used to earn interest on your crypto assets. Users deposit their crypto assets into their chosen platform and receive cTokens in return. Those users who need to borrow against their crypto assets are protecting themselves when they use Compound. The protocol used for the loan ensures your collateral stays above the value of your loan. This keeps your assets from being liquidated to repay the loan.</p>



<h2 id="perspectives-and-takeaways"><br>Perspectives and Takeaways</h2>



<p>While Compound (COMP) is only trading on a few lesser cryptocurrency exchanges, it is still a hot commodity. Its value doubled days after its release, and many data sites like CoinGecko, The Block, Forbes Crypto, and others are having trouble coming up with COMP’s market value because it is still so new. The cryptocurrency got a boost from Coinbase when they announced that Coinbase Pro users could start trading the tokens at the end of June in every jurisdiction except New York State.</p>



<p>The current frenzy over COMP is due to the speculation over blockchain systems that let users borrow against cryptocurrency and other digital assets without the need for banks and exchanges. It makes it easy for anyone with cryptocurrency accounts to invest their money and get more out of it without a middleman being involved.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="445"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/comp2.png"  alt="compound pic 3"  class="wp-image-29215"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/comp2.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/comp2.png 1024w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/comp2.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/comp2.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/comp2.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/comp2.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/comp2.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/comp2.png 1280w"  sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" ></figure>



<p>There is a concern in the cryptocurrency world that Compound COMP tokens could get caught up in a speculative cycle. The concern is that the market value will grow more than the tokens actual value before going down, triggering a reduction of incentives to hold onto the tokens. If this happens, less interest will be generated in COMP, and the value could tank.</p>



<p>With COMP already being listed on Coinbase’s Pro and retail platform, the movement of tokens will start happening rapidly. The listing on Coinbase was one of the training platforms fastest following the launch of a new cryptocurrency. The 20% boost it received has helped, and it was trending just under $250 at the end of the week after the listing.</p>



<p>Soon after launch, this kind of movement could have something to do with users getting free tokens when they borrowed against themselves. Because COMP is a governance token, it is awarded to anyone who uses the platform to borrow or lend, as much as possible. COMP tokens are being used as a swap meet with some users borrowing against themselves up to 30 times to maximize the amount of COMP they can get. Additionally, some COMP were being purchased from spot markets to drive prices up further.</p>



<p>To protect investors in case COMP takes a downturn, Opyn, the service that protects your DeFi deposits and hedges ETH risks, offered a “put option” on COMP at the price of $150. This means users can sell their COMP for $150 before the expiration date to protect their investment. Users are not obligated to sell their COMP but can if they invest in the “put option.” Right now, the expiration date is July 3. Setting up the “put option,” speculators are watching COMP carefully just in case it does tank. Considering it sold for $80 when COMP hit the market and is now selling around $250, investors buying into the “put option” are capping any downside risks. Cryptocurrency is known to rally after launch before dropping and rebuilding its value.</p>

<p>When a user interacts with Compound (COMP) – whether they are supplying, withdrawing, borrowing, or repaying – COMP is automatically transferred into their digital wallet as long as the user has accrued at least .001 COMP. All undistributed COMP can be manually withdrawn at any time.</p>



<p>User can then view their accrued COMP by searching the Compound Governance Explorer profile page. This is done per wallet address. Distributions can only be made to the address that has accrued the COMP. This means that your digital wallet has to be able to send COMP from the same address that is interacting with Compound. If it cannot be done, users could face the problem of not being able to claim the asset, and it will become inaccessible and lost.</p>



<p>Compound is currently supported in the Atomic Wallet. The wallet will let you manage, exchange, and buy a large number of digital assets with your bank card. You have total control over your funds as your private keys are generated by a mnemonic seed, and all is encrypted and never leaves your device. Atomic is one of the best solutions to storing COMP. Install and try out the app now to manage your COMP in the wallet interface.</p>



<h2 id="conclusion"><br>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Compound (COMP), an Ethereum protocol, is designed to allow users to borrow, invest, use, and short-sell tokens. Because the protocol has been set up to establish a money market with set interest rates, COMP also provides users with the ability to earn interest when the protocol users use cTokens and ETH.</p>



<p>Interest rates for loans are based on the money market’s supply and demand for the asset being used for the loan. Users of Compound can supply tokens to a money market to earn interest without the assistance of a central party. They can also borrow tokens against their collateral balance.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/how-to-mine-etc-1920x1080.png"  alt="ETH Mining cover"  class="wp-image-27902" ></figure>



<p>Ethereum is a popular open-source and programmable blockchain, which was launched in late July 2015. Its features include a cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH).&nbsp;</p>



<p>At present, ETH is the world’s second-largest digital currency by market capitalization, after Bitcoin (BTC). In contrast to Bitcoin, there is no upper limit on the available supply of coins.</p>



<p>In this guide, you’ll find out how to get set up to mine Ethereum, the best types of equipment to use and where to store your coins.</p>



<h2 id="what-is-ethereum-mining"><br>What is Ethereum Mining?</h2>



<p>Ethereum mining plays an important social function. It minimizes the risk of fraudulent entries on the blockchain by ensuring all new records are verified and agreed upon by the group.</p>



<p>Right now, Ethereum uses a ‘Proof of Work’ algorithm called Ethash. This system promotes decentralization by giving individual miners an incentive to confirm transactions on the ledger.</p>



<p>Every time a new block is released, miners from all over the world compete in a race to solve a unique mathematical puzzle. The winner gets two freshly created ETH coins as a reward.</p>



<p>Blocks are designed to be mined every 12 seconds (on average). If an influx of miners were to speed up the process, the algorithm would be tweaked to make it more challenging to solve.</p>



<p>(It’s worth bearing in mind that work is underway to move from a&nbsp;<em>Proof of Work</em>&nbsp;to a&nbsp;<em>Proof of Stake</em>&nbsp;framework. This will make the traditional role of Ethereum miners redundant.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="445"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc4.png"  alt="pic 1"  class="wp-image-27957"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc4.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc4.png 1024w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc4.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc4.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc4.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc4.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc4.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc4.png 1280w"  sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" ></figure>



<h2 id="ethereum-mining-hardware"><br>Ethereum Mining Hardware</h2>



<p>The complexity of Ethereum’s hashing algorithm (and the sheer volume of mining competition) requires some serious computational power. In short, a simple CPU probably won’t cut it.</p>



<p>At the same time, Ethash is a memory-intensive algorithm. Accordingly, the hyper-powerful ASICs that have come to dominate Bitcoin mining are not a practical solution either.</p>



<p>By far, the best option is to buy a graphics card (GPU). These will deliver a much higher hash rate than a CPU, and several GPUs can be stacked in a rig to multiply your processing power.</p>



<p>When selecting a GPU, you’ll need to balance total costs (price and electricity usage) against performance (hash rate). Use a free profitability calculator to check if it’s a viable endeavor.</p>



<p>Some of the best GPU models available on the market include Nvidia’s GTX and AMD’s Radeon RX series.</p>



<h2 id="ethereum-mining-software"><br>Ethereum Mining Software</h2>



<p>There are several steps you’ll need to take to configure your system before you can start mining. First, install the correct driver for your GPU (instructions should come with purchase).</p>



<p>You’ll also need to download the whole Ethereum blockchain. This could take a while! It’s continually expanding and, at the time of writing (June 2020), stood at over 140MB.</p>



<p>Once that’s all done, the next step is to connect your node to the network and start mining. Take some time to consider the range of mining software options that are available to you.</p>



<p>Good mining software does a lot more than just interface with your graphics cards. It will also tell you the energy efficiency, speed, temperature, and hash rate performance of each GPU.</p>



<p>Choose a package that has a right mix of functionality and ease of use. Two popular options are Ethminer (for PC users &#8211; see below) and Minergate (for Mac users).</p>



<h2 id="ethereum-mining-testing"><br>Ethereum Mining: Testing</h2>



<p>Even if you’ve got the right equipment in place, jumping in and starting mining can be a bit daunting. Testing is a great way to get a feel for mining without having any ‘skin in the game’.</p>



<p>You can simulate your mining capabilities on a private network using a client such as Geth. In this environment, you’ll be the only participant working to confirm new blocks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="445"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc3.png"  alt="pic 2"  class="wp-image-27924"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc3.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc3.png 1024w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc3.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc3.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc3.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc3.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc3.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc3.png 1280w"  sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" ></figure>



<h2 id="installing-ethminer-for-ethereum-mining"><br>Installing Ethminer for Ethereum Mining</h2>



<p>As mentioned earlier, Ethminer is one of the best Windows software packages for Ethereum mining. It’s a versatile open-source application that can be used for solo and pool mining.</p>



<p>First, you’ll need to find and install Ethminer (available via GitHub). After that, you’ll be ready to instruct the software to run Ethash and solve new blocks of transitions on the ledger.</p>



<p>But be aware that you’ll need a valid public address to receive Ether once it’s been mined. For more on this, see&nbsp;<em>‘Where to Store Ethereum (ETH)’</em>&nbsp;(below).</p>



<h2 id="ethereum-mining-8211-getting-paid"><br>Ethereum Mining &#8211; Getting Paid</h2>



<p>When a miner solves a block of transactions, they are assigned a reward in the form of new Ether coins. Following a hard fork event in 2019, this payment amount has been reduced from 3 ETH to 2 ETH.</p>



<p>At current market value, that’s about US$250 &#8211; far less than Bitcoin’s $60,000 or so per block. That said, new ETH is mined every 12 seconds (compared to around 10 minutes for BTC).</p>



<p>In addition to the official reward of 2 ETH, the successful miner receives all of the transaction and processing fees from that block. The total payout is then sent to a nominated address.</p>



<p>Once the ETH arrives in your wallet, you can hold it or exchange it for another fiat (or crypto-) currency. If sent to a pool, you’ll need to wait for the pool to share its combined rewards.</p>



<h2 id="ethereum-mining-pools"><br>Ethereum Mining Pools</h2>



<p>As Ethereum mining competition has soared, the rewards available to solo miners have diminished. This means you could go for months or even years without striking digital ‘gold.’</p>



<p>A more attractive solution may be to join a pool. Pools are collectives of miners who put their hashing power together and divide up their rewards according to overall contribution.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="445"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc2.png"  alt="pic 3"  class="wp-image-27935"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc2.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc2.png 1024w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc2.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc2.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc2.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc2.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc2.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etc2.png 1280w"  sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" ></figure>



<p>The most significant advantage of a pool is a steadier (usually daily) flow of returns. But you’ll have to pay a fee, and mining performance can be affected by technical issues in the broader group.</p>



<p>Most pools require a simple online registration. Before you sign up, look at how the different pools compare in terms of fees, trustworthiness, payout structure, and payment frequency.</p>



<p>The biggest pool right now is Ethmine, which has a quarter of the total hash rate on the network and charges a 1% fee. Nanopool and Dwarfpool are two other popular options.</p>



<h2 id="ethereum-mining-profitability"><br>Ethereum Mining Profitability</h2>



<p>Higher competition is driving up the difficulty of mining Ethereum and making it less profitable. Even if ETH prices remain on an upward path, it could still be a good speculative bet.</p>



<p>Whether&nbsp;<em>you’ll</em>&nbsp;be able to make money from Ethereum mining depends mainly on your setup. If you’re unsure about all of this, try an online profitability calculator.</p>



<p>CryptoCompare is one example of an accurate, free profit estimator. The calculation factors in current market conditions include mining difficulty, block rewards, and the exchange rate.</p>



<p>You’ll also need to plug in your GPU’s hash rate and running expenses (i.e., pool fees and electricity costs). Don’t forget about hard and software prices, including replacement costs.</p>



<p>As mentioned, the shift to a&nbsp;<em>Proof of Stake</em>&nbsp;protocol will be a real game-changer for miners. The groundwork for these changes is already being laid in the shape of ‘Ethereum 2.0’.</p>



<h2 id="where-to-store-your-mined-ethereum-eth"><br>Where to Store Your Mined Ethereum (ETH)</h2>



<p>There are tons of wallets of varying levels of ease of use and security. An excellent option for Ethereum miners/traders is Atomic Wallet, which consistently receives five-star reviews.</p>



<p>Atomic Wallet is compatible with all major operating systems and supports over 300 coins (including ETH). It’s simple, secure, and user friendly with a 24/7 client support feature.</p>



<p>Furthermore, there are no additional fees for using the wallet or transferring ETH. The only fee you’ll pay is the (mandatory) transaction cost of a new entry on the blockchain.</p>



<p>To set up Atomic Wallet, download it to your computer or a smartphone. You’ll need to choose a password and keep a secure copy of your assigned seed phrase.</p>



<h2 id="conclusion"><br>Conclusion</h2>



<p>There are many reasons to get involved in Ethereum mining, of which making money is just one. The community is a vibrant and innovative space for blockchain and crypto enthusiasts.</p>



<p>Ethereum’s hashing algorithm gives solo GPU miners a shot at achieving a positive ROI. However, the advent of&nbsp;<em>Proof of Stake</em>&nbsp;looks set to undermine the rewards on offer for miners.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1380"  height="800"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nano.png"  alt="cover"  class="wp-image-27468"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nano.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nano.png 883w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nano.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nano.png 1863w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nano.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nano.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nano.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nano.png 1380w"  sizes="(max-width: 1380px) 100vw, 1380px" ></figure>



<p>NANO is one of the leading cryptocurrencies on the market, which tends to provide better digital solutions and instant transaction speed. In this article, we are going to know more about NANO currency and its main features.</p>



<h2 id="what-is-the-nano-coin"><br>What is the NANO coin?</h2>



<p>NANO is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies across the world. It&#8217;s primarily known for its instant transfer speed and zero fees on transactions. The term &#8220;NANO&#8221; has been rebranded from its previous name, &#8220;RaiBlocks.&#8221; At the beginning of 2018, the company&#8217;s management named its cryptocurrency project as &#8220;NANO.&#8221; This started a new beginning of NANO. NANO differentiates from other cryptocurrencies in that it mainly performs transactions and aims to provide much faster and more flexible transactions.</p>



<p>NANO coin uses a mixture of proof of work and proof of stake algorithms. This combination is called &#8220;delegated proof of stake.&#8221; For example, two of the transactions collide, and one of them is fake, and the other one is legit. To solve this, delegates in it will automatically resolve the legit transaction and dismiss the fraud one.</p>



<p>To have a delegate, you must have some NANO coins in the wallet. This helps in attracting people to participate in the advancement and growth of the NANO community.</p>



<h2 id="nano-brief-history"><br>NANO Brief History</h2>



<p>NANO, first known as Rai blocks, was invented by Colin LaMahieu, a software engineer with years of experience in the computer software field.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img  loading="lazy"  width="1280"  height="445"  src="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nano2.png"  alt="2015"  class="wp-image-27479"  srcset="https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nano2.png 300w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nano2.png 1024w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nano2.png 768w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nano2.png 1920w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nano2.png 1536w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nano2.png 2048w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nano2.png 380w, https://atomicwallet.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nano2.png 1280w"  sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" ></figure>



<p>The main reason behind this initiative was that the original name didn&#8217;t resonate with the target audience company was focusing on. After the name change, they found a sudden increase in the number of transactions.</p>



<p>On some websites, you also might find NANO referred to as &#8220;XRB coin&#8221; XRB stands for Ex RaiBlocks, so it is also correct to refer to coins as both NANO and XRB. Since its inception, NANO shares one vision in its mind: to make peer to peer transactions more scalable and instant.</p>



<p>It is evident that many cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, find scalability one of the biggest challenges. This results in super slow trading and high time consumption. Many altcoins have tried to create a different blockchain version that improves the scalability of cryptocurrencies and NANO is one of them</p>



<h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-nano"><br>What are the Benefits of NANO?</h2>



<p>NANO has several Benefits, and those benefits are divided in terms of technology and transaction wise.</p>



<h3 id="technology-wise"><br>Technology-wise</h3>



<ol><li>Everyone has its blockchain:&nbsp;NANO is the only cryptocurrency that has its blockchain technology with the name of Block-lattice architecture. So, each individual is assigned his blockchain with the name of the account chain.</li><li>Less data requirement as compared to its contemporaries: The architecture automatically settles the account balances. Usually, other cryptocurrencies track all the transaction amounts. Whereas NANO creates its block every time, which automatically replaces the older and replaces it with a new and updated balance.</li><li>Real-time and instant:&nbsp;One of the biggest challenges that cryptocurrencies are facing is slow speed. However, NANO requires no waiting time for the update of the network ledger. The information is smoothly processed by the owner and automatically updated to a more significant block-lattice, resulting in lower time in transactions.</li><li>No transaction fees:&nbsp;&nbsp;NANO charges zero fees on any transaction and exchange, which is a great advantage over many other cryptocurrencies.</li><li>Lower consumption of energy:&nbsp;Energy consumption has been a significant concern for the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

<p>In April 2018, NANO prices were rising to give a quick and fierce competition to the top coins in the Asian market. Its trading price was rising, whereas other major cryptocurrencies were on a declining phase. The NANO coin is currently ranking on the 19th position and recording steady uptrend growth.</p>



<p>Considering its upward trend and advanced features, it seems to give a big competition to major cryptocurrencies. It has got some great partnerships with different businesses to use NANO for transactions.</p>
