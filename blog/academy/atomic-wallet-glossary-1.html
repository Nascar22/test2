Most airdrop campaigns operate with mechanics like getting coins or tokens for easy functions such as exchanging news, mentioning friends, or downloading an app.    Algorithm:    A method or set of regulations to be performed in problem-solving or calculation activities, generally by a machine, although, people also tend to obey measures algorithmically (say math or after a formula).    All-Time-High (ATH):    The highest point in the history of a cryptocurrency (in value, in market capitalization).    All-Time-Low (ATL):    The lowest point in the history of a cryptocurrency (in value, in market capitalization).

Arbitration:    A practice of taking benefit in two or more sectors or transfers of variations in the cost of the same commodity. For instance, rates on Korean markets for cryptocurrency may differ from those on US exchanges. To purchase in one and sell in another for-profit, an arbitrage trader would be in both economies.    ASIC:    Short for \u2018Application Specific Integrated Circuit\u2019. it is mining equipment specifically used to mine a particular cryptocurrency. ASICs are often developed and purchased specifically for mining reasons relative to GPUs and deliver important gains in effectiveness and energy savings owing to their limited use case.        B    Bag:    A large amount of a particular cryptocurrency is deemed a \u201cbag.\u201d How many rely on the person\u2019s definition using the phrase.

Bear Trap:    A method performed by a group of traders to manipulate the cost of a cryptocurrency. The bear trap is laid by simultaneously selling a large quantity of the same cryptocurrency, fooling the public into believing that the cost is coming down. Other traders are selling their coins in reaction to that, further pushing down the cost. Those who laid the trap then discharge it, at a reduced cost purchasing back their coins. The cost then bounces back, enabling them to create a profit.    Bitcoin ATM (BTM):    A Bitcoin withdrawal machine.    Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP):    A technical design document that provides the Bitcoin community with data describing fresh characteristics, procedures or settings that affect the Bitcoin protocol. Suggested protocol modifications will be presented as a BIP. The author of the BIP is accountable for seeking feedback and agreement on the suggested community changes and recording the views of the public.    BitLicense:    A company license granted by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) to cryptocurrency businesses in New York.    Bits:    A bitcoin sub-unit.

Blockchain:    A blockchain is a constantly increasing list of documents called blocks that are connected and guaranteed using cryptography.    Block Explorer:    An internet tool for viewing, among other helpful data, all activities that took place on the blockchain, network hash frequency, and customer development.    Block Height:The number of blocks on the blockchain preceding the block in question, or can be considered before this point as total blocks in the chain.    Block Reward:An incentive for a miner who calculates a valid hash during an effective mining in a block. By contributing to the safety and liveness of the chain, the miner is rewarded with this incentive, ensuring that miners continue to act in the best interests of the blockchain by legitimately participating (instead of hacking) in the process.    Bollinger Band:A device created by Bollinger to assist the recognition of intrinsic pattern identification in rates; in some instances, it is a band that plots two normal deviations back from the easy moving average or exponential moving average.    Bots:    Automated trading technology bots relying on a preset algorithm of buy-and-sell regulations that perform trade instructions incredibly rapidly.    Brute Force Attack (BFA):    A test-and-error technique in which automated software produces and attempts many possible combinations to break a code or illegally gather other\u2019s data.    Bubble:    A bubble depicts a scenario in which business members push rates above their value, generally accompanied by a steep, fast price fall as the market corrects.    Bug Bounty:    A prize for discovering computer code vulnerabilities and problems. Cryptocurrency firms such as protocols, exchanges, and wallets are often provided to define prospective safety breaches or bugs before unfriendly sides exploit them.

Close:    Refers to the cost of closing; comparable to the word used in economic stocks.    Cloud Mining:    Remote handling energy mining leased from firms running facilities in nations like Iceland where electricity is scarce and cost-effective and the ambient temperature is cool throughout the year. Another word for this is the agreement for mining.    Coin:    A coin is an independent cryptocurrency.    Coinbase:    A coinbase is a compulsory-included transaction on a block first built in the Bitcoin scheme, whose yield refers to where to give the mining prize. The coinbase has an input of 100 bytes in the Bitcoin system, where messages can be attached or used as an additional nonce.    Cold Storage:    Cryptocurrencies offline storage, typically comprising non-custodial wallets, USBs, offline pcs, or wallets of the document.    Cold Wallet:    A cold storage as a cryptocurrency wallet, i.e. not linked to the internet.    Confirmations:    Only when it is included in a block on the blockchain is a transaction verified, at which stage it has one confirmation. Another proof is each extra block. Various transactions involve a distinct amount of confirmations to consider a final transaction in cryptocurrency.    Consensus:    Consensus is reached when all network respondents agree on the order and material of files and activities in those blocks (as in Agreement).    Blockchain Consortium:    A private and-operated blockchain in which a consortium shares information that is not readily available to the public while relying on the blockchain\u2019s immutable and transparent properties.

Hash Power \/ Hash Rate:    This is a unit that measures the average amount of power that is used by the blockchain network to perform normally. Calculated by the processing computational power used to find new blocks. Computer hashing speed can be measured in kg \/ s, MG \/ s, GG \/ s, TG \/ s, PG \/ s or EG \/ s, depending on the number of hashes generated per second. To mine bitcoins, you need to solve a large number of mathematical problems, and only after that, you can possibly get cryptocurrency.

Side Chain:    Is a blockchain settled upon the top of the blockchain&nbsp; with the two-way connection between the both chains. Sidechain is used to operate independently using its own protocols or ledger mechanisms.    Simplified Payment Verification (SPV):    The technology allows following the longest chain without the need to run a full-node. Commonly used in cryptocurrency wallets, as it allows users to have a light client installed on their device. SPV checks all the spent coins by syncing with the node by the internet.    SHA-256:    SHA 256 is the name of a cryptographic hash function. SHA 256 derives its name from the acronym Secure Hashing Algorithm. The main task of SHA 256 is to generate 256-signatures for generating addresses, private keys that are used in Bitcoin blockchain and some other projects. SHA-256 is used to protect the blockchain from attacks and can be forced by brute force (spending computational resources on finding the match letters+symbols combination that will give access to a private key). The other function of SHA-256 is making hashes and block linking.&nbsp;    Sharding:    Sharding is an application scaling strategy. Within the framework of sharding, information from a common database is divided into blocks and distributed among different servers, which are called shards.

Calculated by the processing computational power used to find new blocks. Computer hashing speed can be measured in kg / s, MG / s, GG / s, TG / s, PG / s or EG / s, depending on the number of hashes generated per second. To mine bitcoins, you need to solve a large number of mathematical problems, and only after that, you can possibly get cryptocurrency.
